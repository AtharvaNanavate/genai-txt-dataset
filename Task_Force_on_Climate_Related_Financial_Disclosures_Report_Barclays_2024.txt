As a long-term investor, we seek to deliver competitive investment returns for our clients and recognise that climate change is a systemic risk that will impact all sectors and all geographies in which we invest, affecting asset valuations.\nWe believe the transition to net zero is going to be influenced by a number of factors, including market developments, technological advancement, the public policy environment, geopolitical developments and regional variations, and behavioural change in society.\nStrategy\nRisk management\n2023 was a year where a number of climate-related records were broken as well as several noteworthy events taking place:\n\u00b7 The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record2.\n\u00b7 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its AR6 Synthesis report3 in 2023, making it clear that climate change is impacting climate extremes and that weather changes are human induced.\n\u00b7 A number of new regulations and standards came into force in 2023, increasing the momentum on ESG and climate-related reporting.\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\n3\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nAbout and scope of the report\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) climate disclosure requirements, as set out in Chapter 2 of the ESG Sourcebook (the FCA Rules)4, apply to asset managers, including investment managers, in the UK. The FCA Rules incorporate recommendations of the TCFD and apply to four business units within the Barclays PLC Group (the 'Group' or 'Barclays'). The legal entity for three of these business units is Barclays Bank PLC (BBPLC) which is reported separately5. The fourth business operates out of BISL, which is its own legal entity and is the focus of this report.\nBISL is a subsidiary of Barclays6 and its regulated activity is the provision of managed investment services. These are delivered through discretionary portfolio management and unitised Barclays-branded funds.\nBarclays PLC published a Climate and Sustainability report within its Annual Report 2023 including disclosures consistent with the recommendations of the TCFD for the Barclays PLC Group as a whole. Where the Barclays PLC Climate and Sustainability report is relevant to this report, we have referred to it rather than duplicate the content.\nSimplified organisational structure chart7\nBarclays PLC\nBarclays Bank PLC\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited\nBarclays Asset Management Limited\nContractual delegation of activities\n1 Please see the TCFD and IFRS websites for further details.\n2 WMO is United Nations system's authoritative voice on the state and behaviour of the Earth's atmosphere, land and oceans interaction, the weather and climate it produces and the resulting distribution of water resources. 3 Please see the IPCC website for the AR6 Synthesis report.\n4 Please refer to Chapter 2.2 of the ESG Sourcebook for further details. 5 BBPLC TCFD report\n6 Please see the Barclays website for further details.\n7 The organisation chart is a simplified view of the structure.\nIntroduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\n4\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nBISL has been appointed as the investment manager for three fund ranges, including those where Barclays Asset Management Limited (BAML)8 is the Authorised Fund Manager (AFM) within Private Bank and Wealth Management (PBWM), and is responsible for making all day-to-day investment decisions on behalf of every fund. For these fund ranges, BISL delegates the selection of assets, including shares, to other investment managers, by either investing into a fund or by giving a number of managers a portion of the money raised to invest on behalf of BISL (by means of segregated mandates). The discretionary portfolio management (DPM) portfolios typically contain third-party funds and BISL's own funds, but there is a small portion of direct equities held.\nSenior manager's compliance statement\nWe have considered our obligations under Chapter 2 of the FCA's ESG Sourcebook and confirm that the disclosures made in this report, including any third-party or Group disclosures cross-referenced in it, comply with the requirements under that chapter9. BISL is the legal entity in scope of the FCA Rules and guidance.\nThis TCFD entity report10 is separate to the Barclays integrated climate-related financial disclosures entity report - please see the Barclays Group Annual Report 2023 for further details. This report focuses on the climate-related activities of BISL only and covers the assets managed by BISL in relation to its TCFD in-scope business.\nThere will be instances where specific Group policies will be applied to BISL. Where appropriate, there may be instances where BISL specific business- level procedures are applied.\nThis report covers the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. All metrics and data are as of 31 December 2023 unless stated otherwise.\nAs this is the first TCFD report for BISL, it has been prepared recognising that there are areas where further work is required. We have included TCFD-aligned disclosures where it is fair, clear and not misleading for us to do so. We have also explained limitations on our ability to disclose, and the steps being taken to address those limitations.\nJean-Damien Marie Global Head of Investments, Private Bank and Wealth Management\n8 BAML is an asset management firm and the Authorised Fund Manager (\"AFM\") of a range of investment funds domiciled in the UK (a private limited company within the Barclays Group, and a wholly owned subsidiary of BBPLC). BAML is responsible for the investment management, risk management, distribution and administration of those funds - though delegates all day-to-day activities to third parties. 9 Please see the FCA website for the FCA ESG Sourcebook, April 2024.\n10 This report is separate from the BISL and Barclays Private Bank DPM client on-demand reports, where requested and required under the FCA ESG Sourcebook.\nIntroduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\n5\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nContext of Barclays Investment Solutions Limited\nOn 1 May 2023, Barclays completed the transfer of its UK Wealth Management & Investments business to sit alongside the Private Bank. The combined business, Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management (PBWM), provides UK clients with access to the full spectrum of wealth and private banking services, while opening up access to the broader key markets and wealth corridors where Barclays provides Private Banking in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Consequently, internal organisational changes as of December 2023 were ongoing for PBWM. This report reflects the status of BISL for the reporting period.\nWhere appropriate and relevant, reference is made to changes that may have taken place in 2023 or may be ongoing at the time of writing this report. As Barclays Private Bank DPM is a business unit of BBPLC, it is reported within the BBPLC TCFD entity report11.\nPrivate Bank DPM11 and Wealth Management - BISL falls under Wealth Management - are at different stages of addressing climate-related risks and opportunities. The integration of climate-related risks and opportunities were not part of BISL's strategy for the reporting period. Following the creation of the combined PBWM business, we are assessing where synergies can be achieved for BISL's approach to climate with the Private Bank DPM and where BISL climate-specific practices need to be addressed to more fully align with the TCFD recommendations. We have summarised areas for improvement as follows:\n\u00b7 A process was established in Q3 2023 for the BISL Board to have visibility of climate-related activities. We will seek to enhance this process and further improve visibility of climate-related risks and opportunities at BISL Board level.\n\u00b7 Established following the creation of the combined PBWM business, the PBWM Responsible Investing and Sustainability Governance (RISG) Forum will allow enhanced BISL management oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n11 Please see the BBPLC TCFD report located on the Barclays Reporting and Disclosures website. 12 Please see the Barclays Annual Report 2023 for further details.\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\n\u00b7 Identify the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities for BISL's investment management activities over the short, medium and long term.\n\u00b7 Undertake scenario analysis for the AUM in scope of this report and in line with the combined PBWM business to identify the resilience of BISL's investment strategies to different climate-related scenarios.\n\u00b7 Assess how climate could be integrated into the investment due diligence process.\n\u00b7 Evaluate how the risk management process can be enhanced to include climate-related risks.\nAs BISL is in the early stages of understanding climate-related risks and opportunities, we have not set any targets to manage climate-related risks and opportunities in relation to our assets under management.\nThe financial planning process for BISL is determined at a Group level. In 2023, Barclays' financial planning process included a review of the Group's strategy, its implementation and tracking of progress against climate-related targets - as well as capturing a view of climate-related risks and opportunities12. BISL operating as an asset manager does not currently incorporate the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities into its business-specific financial planning processes for the AUM in scope of this report.\nIntroduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\n6\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nGovernance\nBISL governance\nThe BISL Executive Committee oversees two subcommittees - the BISL Investment Committee and BISL Product Committee. During 2023, the BISL Investment Committee was chaired by the Head of UK Multi-Asset Wealth and delegated its role of reviewing, overseeing and approving responsible investment activities to the Responsible Investing (RI) Forum - please see the management oversight section on the following page.\nThe Board of BISL is responsible for the overall leadership of BISL. It also has responsibility for BISL's strategic aims and objectives and approval of its risk appetite within the parameters set by\nthe BBPLC Board. Prior to the creation of the combined PBWM business, the\nBISL Board escalated and reported\ninto the BBPLC Board via the Chair of the BISL Board, who was also a member of the BBPLC Board.

The Head of Responsible Investing was the Chair of the RI Forum. Members included Risk Analytics, Behavioural Finance, Fund Managers, Portfolio Construction, Performance Analytics, Group Sustainability, Compliance, Legal, Business Operational Control and Product Specialists. Meetings were held quarterly.\nInitial discussions took place regarding the approach towards addressing the requirements of the TCFD at the RI Forum in Q3 2023.\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\nThe remit and membership of the RI Forum reflect activities for the reporting period of this report. Following the revised PBWM structure, the RI Forum has been replaced by the PBWM RISG Forum with revised terms of reference. The PBWM RISG Forum reports to the BISL Investment Committee in the revised structure and climate-related discussions will now continue at the PBWM RISG Forum. We will seek to enhance BISL management's visibility of climate- related risks and opportunities at this forum.\nIntroduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\n8\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nStrategy\nClimate-related risks and opportunities\nWe have not identified or assessed the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities over the short, medium and long term.\nESG integration\nMost of the assets we manage on behalf of our clients are invested indirectly, through third-party fund managers. We aim to assess each of these managers based on their ESG credentials, among other relevant factors. Climate-related risks were not assessed for third-party fund managers for the reporting period.\nEvery manager's offering is given a single standalone score from A to C for ESG considerations. We review how ESG is embedded using our proprietary '5P' qualitative research framework.\nScenario analysis\nWe have not undertaken scenario analysis for our AUM in scope of this report and do not apply scenario analysis in our investment and risk decision-making process.\nCollaborative initiatives\nBISL became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI)14 in 2023. Prior to this, and since 2016, BAML was a signatory. In 2023, BISL also became a signatory to the UK Stewardship Code14, which sets high stewardship standards for those investing money on behalf of UK savers and pensioners and those that support them. Stewardship is the responsible allocation, management and oversight of capital to create long-term value for clients and beneficiaries with the aim of achieving sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society.\n14 Please see Glossary of key terms.\nIntroduction\nGovernance\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\n9\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nStrategy\nRisk management\nPlease see the 'Context of Barclays Investment Solutions Limited' section for our plans to further develop processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities in relation to the AUM.\nThe risks associated with climate change are subject to rapidly increasing societal, regulatory and policy focus, both in the UK and internationally. In 2022, Climate Risk became a Principal Risk within Barclays' Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF), aiming to ensure a holistic approach to risk identification, assessment and management. Please see the Barclays Annual Report 2023 for details about the ERMF.\nBarclays' Climate Risk Framework facilitates the structured integration of Climate Risk considerations into the Group's operations. It undergoes regular reviews and updates - including changes to risk taxonomy, definitions and methodology - to align the Framework with changing regulatory expectations and external developments.\nInvestment due diligence\nInvestment risk oversight\nStewardship\nAs part of our investment due diligence (IDD) and ongoing monitoring of\nThe Investment Risk team is independent from the investment\nBISL undertakes engagement and voting in partnership with our\nthird-party managers, we may review their integration of responsible investing.

This includes the strategic asset allocation (SAA), the shorter-term tactical asset allocation (TAA) overlays, the stock selection process and implementation decisions in both client models and\nstewardship services provider, EOS at Federated Hermes (EOS)15, in respect of certain holdings relating to specific services16.

Each manager must pass the ODD before being made available to clients, and is periodically assessed thereafter. ESG considerations may be included in the assessment of the fund structure and whether there is adherence to the appropriate regulatory jurisdiction and country nuances. However, climate considerations were not specifically incorporated into the ODD process for the reporting period.\nThe IRF seeks to identify, monitor and address systemic and idiosyncratic risks arising from investment activity. The IRF operates on a quarterly basis, with ongoing reporting obligations to senior management. Its frequency may be increased should the underlying market conditions warrant greater scrutiny. The framework focuses on a defined list of key risk indicators and the implementation of guidelines and limits within which the investment activity can operate. These risks are mapped to the investment process, with risk ownership attributed at each step. Climate risk was not integrated into the IRF for the reporting period.\nand representative shareholder voice and makes company engagement more effective. The decision to partner with EOS was based on a number of factors, but not specifically on their approach to managing climate change.\nEOS develops engagement strategies specific to each company, subject to engagement, informed by its deep understanding across sectors, themes and markets. Specific environmental and nature-related outcomes, aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that EOS seeks to include are as follows:\nClimate change\nDirect holdings ESG including climate risks are not integrated into the investment process for our direct holdings. Direct holdings represent 6% of the in-scope AUM for the FCA Rules.\nEnsuring company strategies and actions are aligned to the goals of the Paris Agreement to pursue efforts to limit climate change to 1.5\u00baC, and demonstrating that business models are resilient and can adapt to future climate change.\n15 Please see the EOS website for further details.\n16 Direct equity holdings within BISL DPM investment strategies and holdings within segregated mandates that form part of BISL funds.\nIntroduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\n10\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nNatural resources\nProtecting, preserving and restoring natural resources and biodiversity by transitioning to sustainable food systems, avoiding antimicrobial resistance and managing water stress, to enable more affordable access to food and clean water.\nCircular economy and zero pollution Controlling pollution of air, land and water to below harmful levels for humans and other living organisms, and building a circular economy that avoids waste.\nFor climate change, EOS's engagement focuses on companies having a strategy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets aligned to the Paris Agreement17, seeking to limit climate change to 1.5\u00b0C, and political lobbying. In seeking Paris-aligned transition plans, EOS evaluates the credibility of company transition plans, including their reliance on technologies, and seeks to ensure that the governance oversight of investments adequately tests risks and dependencies. EOS also continues to engage with companies in high-methane-emitting sectors to deploy the best available technology to identify and mitigate methane emissions, continue to engage on physical climate risks and work towards a 'just transition' for employees and communities.\nGlossary of key terms\nWe view engagement18 and voting18 as an important mechanism through which to hold management to account and act as a lever to promote change in investee companies on material ESG issues, where appropriate. We believe companies that can better manage material ESG issues could be less prone to severe incidents, such as fraud, litigation or reputational risks.\nVoting forms part of BISL's overall stewardship strategy and is used as a tactical tool to achieve desired changes on ESG issues. BISL receives voting recommendations on upcoming annual general/extraordinary meeting resolutions from EOS. These resolutions are analysed by EOS against a range of voting principles and policies, which are based on international best practice and local regional considerations, such as EOS's Global Voting Guidelines, regional voting principles and country-level voting policies. Based on various metrics, BISL filters EOS's voting recommendations in relation to company holdings and, if deemed necessary, BISL may deviate from EOS's recommendations.\n17 Please see the United Nations website for further details on the Paris Agreement.\n18 Direct equity holdings within BISL DPM investment strategies and holdings within segregated mandates that form part of BISL funds.\nAll voting activities sit alongside engagement practices, reflecting the BISL approach of promoting constructive dialogue with investee companies by building long-term relationships to seek to influence ESG and other practices. This is mostly undertaken by EOS, which engages on behalf of clients including Barclays with a wide range of stakeholders - including government authorities, trade bodies, unions, investors and NGOs - to seek to identify and respond to market-wide and systemic risks.\nIntroduction\nGovernance Strategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nPlease see the 'Context of Barclays Investment Solutions Limited' section for our plans to identify and assess the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our investment activities and developing processes to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks, which will include identifying and using appropriate metrics.\nWe may use data and metrics as part of our initial investment due diligence process, as well as ongoing monitoring of discretionary investments. A qualitative approach is currently taken to assess ESG characteristics for assessing and monitoring third-party funds. While we have disclosed certain climate-related metrics in this section in relation to our AUM, we are providing these for information purposes only and climate-related metrics were not part of our assessment or monitoring for the reporting period.\nData is obtained from different sources, including the investment managers and third-party data vendors, such as MSCI. As such, there may be some limitations in the data we use - please see the 'Data limitations' section for further details.\nThe Implied Temperature Rise (ITR)19 is a forward-looking metric, expressed in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C), which is designed to show the temperature alignment of a company to limit global warming to below 2\u2103 by 210019,20. The temperature measurement shows the outcome, if the whole economy had the same carbon budget over-/undershoot level as the company. It provides an indication of how companies and investment portfolios align to global climate targets. At a portfolio level, the ITR is compiled on an aggregated basis for the companies.\nThe ITR for the in-scope AUM for BISL is 2.3 \u00b0C. The ITR is a weighted average of the in-scope AUM, which include direct holdings and third-party funds. The assets included in the metrics calculation for the ITR is 72.3% of the AUM in scope of this report. Due to data limitations, we are unable to have an ITR metric that includes 100% of our in-scope AUM. Whilst the ITR focuses on carbon emissions from corporates, the majority of the data gap for the ITR is attributed to sovereigns and supranationals, which MSCI does not include in its methodology. PBWM is currently dependent on the methodology and capabilities of MSCI. Please see the '2023 metrics' section for further details.\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\n11\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nAs BISL is in the early stages of understanding climate-related risks and opportunities, we have not set any targets to manage climate-related risks and opportunities. Together with the Private Bank DPM, BISL is currently reviewing and assessing the implications of a climate strategy for PBWM following the convergence of the two business areas in 2023. We will report on its progress in next year's report.\n19 Please see Glossary of key terms for further details.\n20 Based on MSCI methodology. Such temperature metrics are based on projections and so are indicative only, may be sensitive to change and based on estimates which may not be accurate or complete. There is no guarantee that each company has set net-zero targets or that a company will be able to achieve its emission reduction targets or that even if such targets are achieved, future warming or emissions levels will be as predicted.\nIntroduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\n12\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nCalculation methodology\nThis section outlines the calculations used for the metrics referred to in this report, as well as what we consider to be the pros and cons for each.\nTable 1\nDescription\nCalculation\nPros\nCons\nTotal emissions\nThis measures the total emissions of a portfolio.\nMtCO2e = Current value of investment Issuer's EVIC X Issuer's GHG emissions)\n\u00b7 As an absolute metric, it is easier to interpret. .

However, there is currently no universally accepted way of reporting, rating or categorising ESG data and so, where we rely on third-party data, such data may be subject to certain limitations. These limitations can be categorised as follows:\nStrategy\nMetrics and targets\n15\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nQuality\nThe ESG and climate data we use is commonly based on estimations that are the output of our third-party data vendors' estimation methodologies, one example of this being the scope 3 GHG emissions of portfolio companies. Furthermore, ESG data may not be audited or otherwise reviewed by an independent third party. While we will use sources that we believe to be reliable, we do not guarantee the information is accurate, complete, and up to date. Our reliance on these estimation methodologies means that the calculated metrics can only be interpreted to be approximate and not precise.\nTransparency\nWe can have limited visibility on the exact details behind an estimated data point from third-party data providers. This impedes our ability on full transparency of the estimated ESG and climate data points in our calculations.\nTimeliness\nWe source ESG and climate data from public reports for our portfolio companies, which are commonly produced on a quarterly or annual cycle. Consequently, the ESG and climate data reported against our portfolio companies maybe out of sync as at the end of the TCFD reporting period.\nCoverage\nThe levels of disclosure of ESG and climate data are particularly low from certain holdings, such as supranationals. As a result, these holdings have been excluded from the scope of assets for this report's metric calculations.\nWe are reviewing alternative climate-related data providers to understand how BISL can evolve its approach and reduce gaps identified. As the quality of data, models and methodologies evolve and improve, we will continue enhancing our approach.\nIntroduction\nGovernance\nGlossary of key terms\nAssets under management: AUM represents the aggregate value of client assets managed, advised or otherwise contracted, from which the entity, including joint ventures and associates, earns operating revenue.\nEnterprise value including cash (EVIC): The sum of the market capitalisation of ordinary shares at fiscal year-end, the market capitalisation of preferred shares at fiscal year-end, and the book values of total debt and minorities' interests. No deductions of cash or cash equivalents are made to avoid the possibility of negative enterprise values. Based on the PCAF definition.\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG): Environmental - factors that relate to the quality and functioning of the natural environment and natural systems, e.g., carbon emissions, environmental regulations, water stress and waste. Social - factors that relate to the rights, well-being and interests of people and communities, e.g., labour management, and health and safety. Governance - factors that relate to the management and oversight of companies and investee entities, e.g., board structure and pay.\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\nFund: Funds are collective investments, where investors' money is pooled together and spread across a wide range of underlying investments, helping to spread overall risk.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG): GHG are gases in the Earth's atmosphere that trap heat. The main ones are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. GHG emissions from human activities intensify the greenhouse effect, contributing to climate change. Carbon dioxide, from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, is one of the most important factors in causing climate change. For further details please see the European Environmental Agency.\nNet zero: Refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) that's produced and the amount that's removed from the atmosphere. It can be achieved through a combination of emission reduction and emission removal. (Net Zero Climate)\nPrinciples for Responsible Investing (PRI): An international network of investors, working together to implement the six PRI principles, and its goal is to encourage its signatories to incorporate ESG issues including climate via the six principles into their investment practices. (PRI)\nScope 1 emissions: Direct GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by a company. (Carbon Trust)\nScope 2 emissions: Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat or cooling consumed by a company. (Carbon Trust)\nScope 3 emissions: Covers all other indirect emissions not included in Scope 2 emissions that occur in the upstream and downstream activities of an organisation. (Carbon Trust)\nImplied temperature rise (ITR): Based on MSCI methodology. The calculation uses an aggregated budget approach that compares the sum of financed projected carbon emissions against the sum of financed carbon emission budgets for underlying portfolio holdings. A company projected to emit carbon below budget can be said to \"undershoot\" the budget. A company projected to exceed the budget \"overshoots\" it. This calculation provides an estimation of the total carbon budget under-/overshoot of the portfolio. The total portfolio carbon emission over/undershoot is then converted to a degree of temperature rise.\n16\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nTaskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): The Financial Stability Board (FSB) created the TCFD to develop recommendations on the types of information that companies should disclose to support investors, lenders and insurance underwriters in appropriately assessing and pricing a specific set of risks related to climate change.\nUK Stewardship Code: The UK Stewardship Code 2020 sets high stewardship standards for those investing money on behalf of UK savers and pensioners, and those that support them. The Code applies to: 1) asset owners such as pension schemes and insurers. 2) asset managers who manage assets on behalf of UK clients or invest in UK assets. 3) service providers such as investment consultants, proxy advisers, and data and research providers that support asset owners and asset managers to exercise their stewardship responsibilities. See the Financial Reporting Council for further details.\nIntroduction\nGovernance\nRisk management Strategy\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\n17\nBarclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024\nDisclaimers\nWhat is important to our clients and stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to anticipate and respond to\nThese factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate disclosures and sustainability- related content.\nWhere we may refer to such terms, there is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies where these are considered. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.\nAny references to 'sustainable',\nWhere we refer to screening processes, there is currently no market consensus, universally accepted framework (legal, regulatory or otherwise), criteria or purely objective way to select investments for sustainable strategies. We use multiple screening processes and analyse a number of factors in our investment selection process that we consider relevant in accordance with our internally defined criteria. Where we have referred to investment selection processes, these include subjective elements which require us to consider whether, on balance, a particular investment is appropriate for inclusion in a sustainable strategy based on our criteria, available information (including ESG data) and professional judgement. Further, ESG considerations are rapidly evolving and may vary by sector/industry, market trends, current science or academic thought, and the macro environment.\nthese changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the\nenvironment and other persons. We have\nadapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate disclosures and\nWe give no assurance as to the likelihood of the achievement or reasonableness of any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns contained in our climate disclosures and sustainability- related content and make no commitment to revise or update any such disclosures to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of such statements. There is currently no universally accepted way of reporting, rating or categorising ESG data and so, where we may refer to, or rely on, third-party data, such data may be subject to certain limitations (including in relation to the quality, timeliness, completeness and availability of such ESG data). Importantly, ESG data may not be audited or otherwise reviewed by an independent third party and while Barclays will use sources it believes to\nsustainability-related content take into account the wider context relevant to\nthese topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks.\nOur climate disclosures and\nIn preparing the climate disclosures and sustainability-related content within the Barclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report wherever it appears, we have:\n\u00b7 Made certain key judgements,\nsustainability-related content are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of\nestimates, judgements and assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies,\nestimations and assumptions.

Where we refer to ESG data, models and methodologies, and any judgements, estimates or assumptions made, are rapidly evolving and this may directly or indirectly affect any metrics and/or data contained herein.\n'sustainable investment', 'ESG','ESG data' or other similar terms or related exclusions in this article are not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.\n\u00b7 Used climate data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and methodologies made available by third parties (over which we have no control) and which may have been prepared using a range of different\nIntroduction\nGovernance\nRisk management\nmethodologies, or where the basis of preparation may not be known to us. Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate data, models, scenarios and methodologies are subject to future risks and uncertainties and may change over time.\nClimate disclosures and sustainability- related content in this document, including climate-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information and use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate disclosures and sustainability- related content are also not subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data cannot be relied on as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis\nStrategy\n\u00b7 Continued (and will continue) to review and develop our approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with market principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and methodologies used (including those made available by third parties) and the judgements, estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may directly or indirectly affect the metrics and data points contained in the climate disclosures and sustainability-related content within this report. Further, changes in external factors which are outside of our control such as accounting and/or reporting standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/ or updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact - potentially materially - the performance metrics and data points contained in the climate and sustainability content within this report. In future reports we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties) using updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies, market practices or standards.\nSuch updated information may result in different outcomes than those included in this report. It is important for readers of this report to be aware that direct, like-for-like comparisons of each piece of information disclosed may not always be possible from one reporting period to another.\nMetrics and targets\nGlossary of key terms\n.

"BISL climate-specific practices need"
"to be addressed to more fully align with"
"the TCFD recommendations. We have"
"summarised areas for improvement"
"as follows:"
"\u00b7 A process was established in"
"Q3 2023 for the BISL Board to"
"have visibility of climate-related"
"activities. We will seek to enhance"
"this process and further improve"
"visibility of climate-related risks and"

"The risks associated with climate"

"societal, regulatory and policy focus,"
"both in the UK and internationally. In"
"2022, Climate Risk became a Principal"
"Risk within Barclays' Enterprise Risk"
"Management Framework (ERMF),"
"aiming to ensure a holistic approach"
"to risk identification, assessment and"
"management. Please see the Barclays"
"Annual Report 2023 for details about"
"the ERMF."
"Barclays' Climate Risk Framework"
"facilitates the structured integration"
"of Climate Risk considerations into"
"the Group's operations. It undergoes"

"(IRF) seeks to challenge each layer of"
"the investment process. This includes"
"the strategic asset allocation (SAA),"
"the shorter-term tactical asset"
"allocation (TAA) overlays, the stock"
"selection process and implementation"
"decisions in both client models and"
"stewardship services provider, EOS at"
"Federated Hermes (EOS)15, in respect"

"periodically assessed thereafter. ESG"
"considerations may be included in the"

"whether there is adherence to the"
"appropriate regulatory jurisdiction and"

"considerations were not specifically"
"incorporated into the ODD process for"
"the reporting period."
"The IRF seeks to identify, monitor and"
"address systemic and idiosyncratic"
"risks arising from investment activity."
"The IRF operates on a quarterly basis,"
"with ongoing reporting obligations to"
"senior management. Its frequency may"
"be increased should the underlying"
"market conditions warrant greater"
"scrutiny. The framework focuses on a"
"defined list of key risk indicators and the"

"ownership attributed at each step."
"Climate risk was not integrated into the"

"and representative shareholder voice"
"and makes company engagement more"
"effective. The decision to partner with"
"EOS was based on a number of factors,"
"but not specifically on their approach to"
"managing climate change."
"EOS develops engagement strategies"
"specific to each company, subject to"
"engagement, informed by its deep"
"understanding across sectors, themes"
"and markets. Specific environmental"
"and nature-related outcomes, aligned"

"Please see the 'Context of Barclays"
"Investment Solutions Limited'"
"section for our plans to identify and"
"assess the impact of climate-related"
"risks and opportunities on our"
"investment activities and developing"
"processes to identify, assess and"
"manage climate-related risks, which"
"will include identifying and using"
"appropriate metrics."
"We may use data and metrics as part"
"of our initial investment due diligence"
"process, as well as ongoing monitoring"
"of discretionary investments. A"
"qualitative approach is currently taken"
"to assess ESG characteristics for"
"assessing and monitoring third-party"
"funds. While we have disclosed certain"
"climate-related metrics in this section"
"in relation to our AUM, we are providing"
"these for information purposes only"
"and climate-related metrics were not"
"part of our assessment or monitoring"
"for the reporting period."
"Data is obtained from different sources,"
"including the investment managers"
"and third-party data vendors, such"
"as MSCI. As such, there may be some"
"limitations in the data we use - please"
"see the 'Data limitations' section for"
"further details."
"The Implied Temperature Rise (ITR)19"
"is a forward-looking metric, expressed"
"in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C), which is"
"designed to show the temperature"
"alignment of a company to limit global"
"warming to below 2\u2103 by 210019,20. The"
"temperature measurement shows the"
"outcome, if the whole economy had the"
"same carbon budget over-/undershoot"
"level as the company. It provides an"
"indication of how companies and"
"investment portfolios align to global"
"climate targets. At a portfolio level, the"
"ITR is compiled on an aggregated basis"
"for the companies."
"The ITR for the in-scope AUM for BISL"
"is 2.3 \u00b0C. The ITR is a weighted average"
"of the in-scope AUM, which include"
"direct holdings and third-party funds."
"The assets included in the metrics"
"calculation for the ITR is 72.3% of the"
"AUM in scope of this report. Due to"
"data limitations, we are unable to have"
"an ITR metric that includes 100% of our"
"in-scope AUM. Whilst the ITR focuses"
"on carbon emissions from corporates,"
"the majority of the data gap for the"
"ITR is attributed to sovereigns and"
"supranationals, which MSCI does"
"not include in its methodology."
"PBWM is currently dependent on the"
"methodology and capabilities of MSCI."
"Please see the '2023 metrics' section"
"for further details."

"and opportunities, we have not set"

"risks and opportunities. Together"

"Data limitations"
"In creating this report, we have"
"used ESG and climate data from"
"third-party data vendors that we"
"consider appropriate and suitable"
"for these purposes, as at the date on"
"which they were deployed. However,"
"there is currently no universally"
"accepted way of reporting, rating or"
"categorising ESG data and so, where"
"we rely on third-party data, such data"
"may be subject to certain limitations."
"These limitations can be categorised"
"as follows:"
"Strategy"
"Metrics and targets"
"15"
"Barclays Investment Solutions Limited"
"TCFD Report 2024"
"Quality"
"The ESG and climate data we use is commonly based on estimations that are the output of our third-party data vendors'"
"estimation methodologies, one example of this being the scope 3 GHG emissions of portfolio companies. Furthermore,"
"ESG data may not be audited or otherwise reviewed by an independent third party. While we will use sources that we"
"believe to be reliable, we do not guarantee the information is accurate, complete, and up to date. Our reliance on these"
"estimation methodologies means that the calculated metrics can only be interpreted to be approximate and not precise."
"Transparency"
"We can have limited visibility on the exact details behind an estimated data point from third-party data providers. This"
"impedes our ability on full transparency of the estimated ESG and climate data points in our calculations."
"Timeliness"
"We source ESG and climate data from public reports for our portfolio companies, which are commonly produced on a"
"quarterly or annual cycle. Consequently, the ESG and climate data reported against our portfolio companies maybe out"
"of sync as at the end of the TCFD reporting period."
"Coverage"
"The levels of disclosure of ESG and climate data are particularly low from certain holdings, such as supranationals. As a"
"result, these holdings have been excluded from the scope of assets for this report's metric calculations."
"We are reviewing alternative climate-related data providers to understand how BISL can evolve its approach and reduce gaps"
"identified. As the quality of data, models and methodologies evolve and improve, we will continue enhancing our approach."

"Assets under management: AUM"
"represents the aggregate value of"
"client assets managed, advised or"
"otherwise contracted, from which the"
"entity, including joint ventures and"
"associates, earns operating revenue."
"Enterprise value including cash (EVIC):"
"The sum of the market capitalisation"
"of ordinary shares at fiscal year-end,"
"the market capitalisation of preferred"
"shares at fiscal year-end, and the book"
"values of total debt and minorities'"
"interests. No deductions of cash or"
"cash equivalents are made to avoid"
"the possibility of negative enterprise"
"values. Based on the PCAF definition."
"Environmental, social and governance"
"(ESG): Environmental - factors that"
"relate to the quality and functioning of"
"the natural environment and natural"
"systems, e.g., carbon emissions,"
"environmental regulations, water"
"stress and waste. Social - factors that"
"relate to the rights, well-being and"
"interests of people and communities,"
"e.g., labour management, and health"
"and safety. Governance - factors"
"that relate to the management and"
"oversight of companies and investee"
"entities, e.g., board structure and pay."
"Strategy"
"Risk management"
"Metrics and targets"
"Glossary of key terms"
"Fund: Funds are collective investments,"
"where investors' money is pooled"
"together and spread across a wide"
"range of underlying investments,"
"helping to spread overall risk."
"Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG):"
"GHG are gases in the Earth's"
"atmosphere that trap heat. The main"
"ones are carbon dioxide, methane,"
"nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons,"
"perfluorocarbons and sulphur"
"hexafluoride. GHG emissions from"
"human activities intensify the"
"greenhouse effect, contributing to"
"climate change. Carbon dioxide, from"
"burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil"
"and natural gas, is one of the most"
"important factors in causing climate"
"change. For further details please see"
"the European Environmental Agency."
"Net zero: Refers to the balance"
"between the amount of greenhouse"
"gas (GHG) that's produced and the"
"amount that's removed from the"
"atmosphere. It can be achieved through"
"a combination of emission reduction"
"and emission removal."

"of investors, working together to"
"implement the six PRI principles, and"
"its goal is to encourage its signatories"

"climate via the six principles into their"
"investment practices. (PRI)"
"Scope 1 emissions: Direct GHG"
"emissions from sources that are"
"owned or controlled by a company."
"(Carbon Trust)"
"Scope 2 emissions: Indirect GHG"
"emissions from the generation of"
"purchased or acquired electricity,"
"steam, heat or cooling consumed by a"
"company. (Carbon Trust)"
"Scope 3 emissions: Covers all other"
"indirect emissions not included in"
"Scope 2 emissions that occur in the"
"upstream and downstream activities of"
"an organisation. (Carbon Trust)"
"Implied temperature rise (ITR): Based"
"on MSCI methodology. The calculation"
"uses an aggregated budget approach"
"that compares the sum of financed"
"projected carbon emissions against"
"the sum of financed carbon emission"
"budgets for underlying portfolio"
"holdings. A company projected to"
"emit carbon below budget can be"
"said to \"undershoot\" the budget. A"
"company projected to exceed the"
"budget \"overshoots\" it. This calculation"
"provides an estimation of the total"
"carbon budget under-/overshoot"
"of the portfolio. The total portfolio"
"carbon emission over/undershoot"
"is then converted to a degree of"
"temperature rise."

"Disclaimers"
"What is important to our clients and"
"stakeholders evolves over time, and"
"we aim to anticipate and respond to"
"These factors mean disclosures may"
"be amended, updated, and recalculated"
"in future as market practice and data"
"quality and availability develops, and"
"could cause actual achievements, results,"
"performance or other future events"
"or conditions to differ, in some cases"
"materially, from those stated, implied"
"and/or reflected in any forward-looking"
"statements or metrics included in our"
"climate disclosures and sustainability-"
"related content."
"Where we may refer to such terms,"
"there is currently no globally accepted"
"framework or definition (legal, regulatory"
"or otherwise) of, nor market consensus"
"as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green',"
"'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an"
"equivalent company, investment,"
"strategy or consideration or what"
"precise attributes are required to be"
"eligible to be categorised by such terms."
"This means there are different ways to"
"evaluate a company or an investment"
"and so different values may be placed"
"on certain ESG credentials as well"
"as adverse ESG-related impacts of"
"companies and ESG controversies where"
"these are considered. The evolving"
"nature of ESG considerations, models"
"and methodologies means it can be"
"challenging to definitively and universally"
"classify a company or investment under"
"an ESG label and there may be areas"
"where such companies and investments"
"could improve or where adverse ESG-"
"related impacts or ESG controversies"
"exist. The evolving nature of sustainable"
"finance related regulations and the"
"development of jurisdiction-specific"
"regulatory criteria also means that there"
"is likely to be a degree of divergence as"
"to the interpretation of such terms in the"
"market. We expect industry guidance,"
"market practice, and regulations in this"
"field to continue to evolve."
"Any references to 'sustainable',"
"Where we refer to screening processes,"
"there is currently no market consensus,"
"universally accepted framework (legal,"
"regulatory or otherwise), criteria or purely"
"objective way to select investments for"
"sustainable strategies. We use multiple"
"screening processes and analyse a"
"number of factors in our investment"
"selection process that we consider"
"relevant in accordance with our internally"
"defined criteria."
"Where we have referred to investment"
"selection processes, these include"
"subjective elements which require"
"us to consider whether, on balance, a"
"particular investment is appropriate for"
"inclusion in a sustainable strategy based"
"on our criteria, available information"
"(including ESG data) and professional"
"judgement. Further, ESG considerations"
"are rapidly evolving and may vary by"
"sector/industry, market trends, current"
"science or academic thought, and the"
"macro environment."
"these changes. Disclosure expectations"
"in relation to climate change and"
"sustainability matters are particularly fast"
"moving, and differ from more traditional"
"areas of reporting including in relation to"
"the level of detail and forward-looking"
"nature of the information involved and"
"the consideration of impacts on the"
"environment and other persons. We have"
"adapted our approach in relation to the"
"disclosure of such matters."

"The BISL Executive Committee oversees two subcommittees - the BISL Investment Committee and BISL Product Committee. During 2023, the BISL Investment Committee was chaired by the Head of UK Multi-Asset Wealth and delegated its role of reviewing, overseeing and approving responsible investment activities to the Responsible Investing (RI) Forum - please see the management oversight section on the following page."
"The Board of BISL is responsible for the overall leadership of BISL. It also has responsibility for BISL's strategic aims and objectives and approval of its risk appetite within the parameters set by"
"the BBPLC Board. Prior to the creation of the combined PBWM business, the"

"the creation of the combined PBWM business, escalation is by the BISL"
"In Q3 2023, a bi-annual Board report was introduced to begin understanding climate-related risks and opportunities. We will seek to enhance this process by which the BISL Board is informed about climate-related issues, as well as on the broader strategy on managing climate."
"Executive Committee to the BBPLC Board via the Chair of the BISL Board."
"The BISL CEO is delegated authority"
"for the implementation of the strategy and the day-to-day running of BISL, with full powers to sub-delegate such authority as deemed fit. The BISL CEO has elected to discharge certain duties by forming a BISL Executive Committee to which certain authorities may be delegated."

"that pooling the resources of other like-minded investors creates a strong"
"Independent operational due diligence (ODD) is undertaken of a fund manager's operations and product offering, seeking to assess and mitigate business and operational risks. Each manager must pass the ODD before being made available to clients, and is periodically assessed thereafter. ESG considerations may be included in the assessment of the fund structure and whether there is adherence to the appropriate regulatory jurisdiction and country nuances. However, climate considerations were not specifically incorporated into the ODD process for the reporting period."
"The IRF seeks to identify, monitor and address systemic and idiosyncratic risks arising from investment activity. The IRF operates on a quarterly basis, with ongoing reporting obligations to senior management. Its frequency may be increased should the underlying market conditions warrant greater scrutiny. The framework focuses on a defined list of key risk indicators and the implementation of guidelines and limits within which the investment activity can operate. These risks are mapped to the investment process, with risk ownership attributed at each step. Climate risk was not integrated into the IRF for the reporting period."
"and representative shareholder voice and makes company engagement more effective. The decision to partner with EOS was based on a number of factors, but not specifically on their approach to managing climate change."
"EOS develops engagement strategies specific to each company, subject to engagement, informed by its deep understanding across sectors, themes and markets. Specific environmental and nature-related outcomes, aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that EOS seeks to include are as follows:"
"Direct holdings ESG including climate risks are not integrated into the investment process for our direct holdings. Direct holdings represent 6% of the in-scope AUM for the FCA Rules."

"These factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate disclosures and sustainability- related content."
"Where we may refer to such terms, there is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies where these are considered. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve."
"Where we refer to screening processes, there is currently no market consensus, universally accepted framework (legal, regulatory or otherwise), criteria or purely objective way to select investments for sustainable strategies. We use multiple screening processes and analyse a number of factors in our investment selection process that we consider relevant in accordance with our internally defined criteria. Where we have referred to investment selection processes, these include subjective elements which require us to consider whether, on balance, a particular investment is appropriate for inclusion in a sustainable strategy based on our criteria, available information (including ESG data) and professional judgement. Further, ESG considerations are rapidly evolving and may vary by sector/industry, market trends, current science or academic thought, and the macro environment."

"Climate change"
"Welcome to the first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)1 report from Barclays Investment Solutions Limited (BISL) ('we' or 'our')."
"Climate change is an urgent challenge with far-reaching implications for our planet and society. As a long-term investor, we seek to deliver competitive investment returns for our clients and recognise that climate change is a systemic risk that will impact all sectors and all geographies in which we invest, affecting asset valuations."
"We believe the transition to net zero is going to be influenced by a number of factors, including market developments, technological advancement, the public policy environment, geopolitical developments and regional variations, and behavioural change in society."
"Strategy"
"Risk management"
"2023 was a year where a number of climate-related records were broken as well as several noteworthy events taking place:"
"\u00b7 The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record2."
"\u00b7 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its AR6 Synthesis report3 in 2023, making it clear that climate change is impacting climate extremes and that weather changes are human induced."
"\u00b7 A number of new regulations and standards came into force in 2023, increasing the momentum on ESG and climate-related reporting."

"About and scope of the report"
"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) climate disclosure requirements, as set out in Chapter 2 of the ESG Sourcebook (the FCA Rules)4, apply to asset managers, including investment managers, in the UK. The FCA Rules incorporate recommendations of the TCFD and apply to four business units within the Barclays PLC Group (the 'Group' or 'Barclays'). The legal entity for three of these business units is Barclays Bank PLC (BBPLC) which is reported separately5. The fourth business operates out of BISL, which is its own legal entity and is the focus of this report."
"BISL is a subsidiary of Barclays6 and its regulated activity is the provision of managed investment services. These are delivered through discretionary portfolio management and unitised Barclays-branded funds."
"Barclays PLC published a Climate and Sustainability report within its Annual Report 2023 including disclosures consistent with the recommendations of the TCFD for the Barclays PLC Group as a whole. Where the Barclays PLC Climate and Sustainability report is relevant to this report, we have referred to it rather than duplicate the content."

"BISL has been appointed as the investment manager for three fund ranges, including those where Barclays Asset Management Limited (BAML)8 is the Authorised Fund Manager (AFM) within Private Bank and Wealth Management (PBWM), and is responsible for making all day-to-day investment decisions on behalf of every fund. For these fund ranges, BISL delegates the selection of assets, including shares, to other investment managers, by either investing into a fund or by giving a number of managers a portion of the money raised to invest on behalf of BISL (by means of segregated mandates). The discretionary portfolio management (DPM) portfolios typically contain third-party funds and BISL's own funds, but there is a small portion of direct equities held."
"Senior manager's compliance statement"
"We have considered our obligations under Chapter 2 of the FCA's ESG Sourcebook and confirm that the disclosures made in this report, including any third-party or Group disclosures cross-referenced in it, comply with the requirements under that chapter9. BISL is the legal entity in scope of the FCA Rules and guidance."
"This TCFD entity report10 is separate to the Barclays integrated climate-related financial disclosures entity report - please see the Barclays Group Annual Report 2023 for further details. This report focuses on the climate-related activities of BISL only and covers the assets managed by BISL in relation to its TCFD in-scope business."
"There will be instances where specific Group policies will be applied to BISL. Where appropriate, there may be instances where BISL specific business- level procedures are applied."
"This report covers the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. All metrics and data are as of 31 December 2023 unless stated otherwise."
"As this is the first TCFD report for BISL, it has been prepared recognising that there are areas where further work is required. We have included TCFD-aligned disclosures where it is fair, clear and not misleading for us to do so. We have also explained limitations on our ability to disclose, and the steps being taken to address those limitations."

"Context of Barclays Investment Solutions Limited"
"On 1 May 2023, Barclays completed the transfer of its UK Wealth Management & Investments business to sit alongside the Private Bank. The combined business, Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management (PBWM), provides UK clients with access to the full spectrum of wealth and private banking services, while opening up access to the broader key markets and wealth corridors where Barclays provides Private Banking in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Consequently, internal organisational changes as of December 2023 were ongoing for PBWM. This report reflects the status of BISL for the reporting period."
"Where appropriate and relevant, reference is made to changes that may have taken place in 2023 or may be ongoing at the time of writing this report. As Barclays Private Bank DPM is a business unit of BBPLC, it is reported within the BBPLC TCFD entity report11."
"Private Bank DPM11 and Wealth Management - BISL falls under Wealth Management - are at different stages of addressing climate-related risks and opportunities. The integration of climate-related risks and opportunities were not part of BISL's strategy for the reporting period. Following the creation of the combined PBWM business, we are assessing where synergies can be achieved for BISL's approach to climate with the Private Bank DPM and where BISL climate-specific practices need to be addressed to more fully align with the TCFD recommendations. We have summarised areas for improvement as follows:"
"\u00b7 A process was established in Q3 2023 for the BISL Board to have visibility of climate-related activities. We will seek to enhance this process and further improve visibility of climate-related risks and opportunities at BISL Board level."
"\u00b7 Established following the creation of the combined PBWM business, the PBWM Responsible Investing and Sustainability Governance (RISG) Forum will allow enhanced BISL management oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities."

"\u00b7 Assess how climate could be integrated into the investment due diligence process."
"\u00b7 Evaluate how the risk management process can be enhanced to include climate-related risks."
"As BISL is in the early stages of understanding climate-related risks and opportunities, we have not set any targets to manage climate-related risks and opportunities in relation to our assets under management."
"The financial planning process for BISL is determined at a Group level. In 2023, Barclays' financial planning process included a review of the Group's strategy, its implementation and tracking of progress against climate-related targets - as well as capturing a view of climate-related risks and opportunities12. BISL operating as an asset manager does not currently incorporate the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities into its business-specific financial planning processes for the AUM in scope of this report."

"BISL became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI)14 in 2023. Prior to this, and since 2016, BAML was a signatory. In 2023, BISL also became a signatory to the UK Stewardship Code14, which sets high stewardship standards for those investing money on behalf of UK savers and pensioners and those that support them. Stewardship is the responsible allocation, management and oversight of capital to create long-term value for clients and beneficiaries with the aim of achieving sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society."

"The risks associated with climate change are subject to rapidly increasing societal, regulatory and policy focus, both in the UK and internationally. In 2022, Climate Risk became a Principal Risk within Barclays' Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF), aiming to ensure a holistic approach to risk identification, assessment and management. Please see the Barclays Annual Report 2023 for details about the ERMF."

However, climate considerations were not specifically incorporated into the ODD process for the reporting period."
"The IRF seeks to identify, monitor and address systemic and idiosyncratic risks arising from investment activity. The IRF operates on a quarterly basis, with ongoing reporting obligations to senior management. Its frequency may be increased should the underlying market conditions warrant greater scrutiny. The framework focuses on a defined list of key risk indicators and the implementation of guidelines and limits within which the investment activity can operate. These risks are mapped to the investment process, with risk ownership attributed at each step. Climate risk was not integrated into the IRF for the reporting period."

Based on various metrics, BISL filters EOS's voting recommendations in relation to company holdings and, if deemed necessary, BISL may deviate from EOS's recommendations."
"17 Please see the United Nations website for further details on the Paris Agreement."
"18 Direct equity holdings within BISL DPM investment strategies and holdings within segregated mandates that form part of BISL funds."
"All voting activities sit alongside engagement practices, reflecting the BISL approach of promoting constructive dialogue with investee companies by building long-term relationships to seek to influence ESG and other practices. This is mostly undertaken by EOS, which engages on behalf of clients including Barclays with a wide range of stakeholders - including government authorities, trade bodies, unions, investors and NGOs - to seek to identify and respond to market-wide and systemic risks."

"Risk management"
"Metrics and targets"
"Please see the 'Context of Barclays Investment Solutions Limited' section for our plans to identify and assess the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our investment activities and developing processes to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks, which will include identifying and using appropriate metrics."
"We may use data and metrics as part of our initial investment due diligence process, as well as ongoing monitoring of discretionary investments. A qualitative approach is currently taken to assess ESG characteristics for assessing and monitoring third-party funds. While we have disclosed certain climate-related metrics in this section in relation to our AUM, we are providing these for information purposes only and climate-related metrics were not part of our assessment or monitoring for the reporting period."
"Data is obtained from different sources, including the investment managers and third-party data vendors, such as MSCI. As such, there may be some limitations in the data we use - please see the 'Data limitations' section for further details."
"The Implied Temperature Rise (ITR)19 is a forward-looking metric, expressed in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C), which is designed to show the temperature alignment of a company to limit global warming to below 2\u2103 by 210019,20. The temperature measurement shows the outcome, if the whole economy had the same carbon budget over-/undershoot level as the company. It provides an indication of how companies and investment portfolios align to global climate targets. At a portfolio level, the ITR is compiled on an aggregated basis for the companies."
"The ITR for the in-scope AUM for BISL is 2.3 \u00b0C. The ITR is a weighted average of the in-scope AUM, which include direct holdings and third-party funds. The assets included in the metrics calculation for the ITR is 72.3% of the AUM in scope of this report. Due to data limitations, we are unable to have an ITR metric that includes 100% of our in-scope AUM. Whilst the ITR focuses on carbon emissions from corporates, the majority of the data gap for the ITR is attributed to sovereigns and supranationals, which MSCI does not include in its methodology. PBWM is currently dependent on the methodology and capabilities of MSCI. Please see the '2023 metrics' section for further details."

"As BISL is in the early stages of understanding climate-related risks and opportunities, we have not set any targets to manage climate-related risks and opportunities. Together with the Private Bank DPM, BISL is currently reviewing and assessing the implications of a climate strategy for PBWM following the convergence of the two business areas in 2023. We will report on its progress in next year's report."

"20 Based on MSCI methodology. Such temperature metrics are based on projections and so are indicative only, may be sensitive to change and based on estimates which may not be accurate or complete. There is no guarantee that each company has set net-zero targets or that a company will be able to achieve its emission reduction targets or that even if such targets are achieved, future warming or emissions levels will be as predicted."

"Data limitations"
"In creating this report, we have used ESG and climate data from third-party data vendors that we consider appropriate and suitable for these purposes, as at the date on which they were deployed. However, there is currently no universally accepted way of reporting, rating or categorising ESG data and so, where we rely on third-party data, such data may be subject to certain limitations. These limitations can be categorised as follows:"
"Strategy"
"Metrics and targets"
"15"
"Barclays Investment Solutions Limited TCFD Report 2024"
"Quality"
"The ESG and climate data we use is commonly based on estimations that are the output of our third-party data vendors' estimation methodologies, one example of this being the scope 3 GHG emissions of portfolio companies. Furthermore, ESG data may not be audited or otherwise reviewed by an independent third party. While we will use sources that we believe to be reliable, we do not guarantee the information is accurate, complete, and up to date. Our reliance on these estimation methodologies means that the calculated metrics can only be interpreted to be approximate and not precise."
"Transparency"
"We can have limited visibility on the exact details behind an estimated data point from third-party data providers. This impedes our ability on full transparency of the estimated ESG and climate data points in our calculations."
"Timeliness"
"We source ESG and climate data from public reports for our portfolio companies, which are commonly produced on a quarterly or annual cycle. Consequently, the ESG and climate data reported against our portfolio companies maybe out of sync as at the end of the TCFD reporting period."
"Coverage"
"The levels of disclosure of ESG and climate data are particularly low from certain holdings, such as supranationals. As a result, these holdings have been excluded from the scope of assets for this report's metric calculations."
"We are reviewing alternative climate-related data providers to understand how BISL can evolve its approach and reduce gaps identified. As the quality of data, models and methodologies evolve and improve, we will continue enhancing our approach."
"Introduction"
"Governance"
"Glossary of key terms"
"Assets under management: AUM represents the aggregate value of client assets managed, advised or otherwise contracted, from which the entity, including joint ventures and associates, earns operating revenue."
"Enterprise value including cash (EVIC): The sum of the market capitalisation of ordinary shares at fiscal year-end, the market capitalisation of preferred shares at fiscal year-end, and the book values of total debt and minorities' interests. No deductions of cash or cash equivalents are made to avoid the possibility of negative enterprise values. Based on the PCAF definition."
"Environmental, social and governance (ESG): Environmental - factors that relate to the quality and functioning of the natural environment and natural systems, e.g., carbon emissions, environmental regulations, water stress and waste. Social - factors that relate to the rights, well-being and interests of people and communities, e.g., labour management, and health and safety. Governance - factors that relate to the management and oversight of companies and investee entities, e.g., board structure and pay."
"Strategy"
"Risk management"
"Metrics and targets"
"Glossary of key terms"
"Fund: Funds are collective investments, where investors' money is pooled together and spread across a wide range of underlying investments, helping to spread overall risk."
"Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG): GHG are gases in the Earth's atmosphere that trap heat. The main ones are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. GHG emissions from human activities intensify the greenhouse effect, contributing to climate change. Carbon dioxide, from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, is one of the most important factors in causing climate change. For further details please see the European Environmental Agency."
"Net zero: Refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) that's produced and the amount that's removed from the atmosphere. It can be achieved through a combination of emission reduction and emission removal. (Net Zero Climate)"
"Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI): An international network of investors, working together to implement the six PRI principles, and its goal is to encourage its signatories to incorporate ESG issues including climate via the six principles into their investment practices. (PRI)"
"Scope 1 emissions: Direct GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by a company. (Carbon Trust)"
"Scope 2 emissions: Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat or cooling consumed by a company. (Carbon Trust)"
"Scope 3 emissions: Covers all other indirect emissions not included in Scope 2 emissions that occur in the upstream and downstream activities of an organisation. (Carbon Trust)"
"Implied temperature rise (ITR): Based on MSCI methodology. The calculation uses an aggregated budget approach that compares the sum of financed projected carbon emissions against the sum of financed carbon emission budgets for underlying portfolio holdings. A company projected to emit carbon below budget can be said to \"undershoot\" the budget. A company projected to exceed the budget \"overshoots\" it. This calculation provides an estimation of the total carbon budget under-/overshoot of the portfolio. The total portfolio carbon emission over/undershoot is then converted to a degree of temperature rise."

"Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): The Financial Stability Board (FSB) created the TCFD to develop recommendations on the types of information that companies should disclose to support investors, lenders and insurance underwriters in appropriately assessing and pricing a specific set of risks related to climate change."
"UK Stewardship Code: The UK Stewardship Code 2020 sets high stewardship standards for those investing money on behalf of UK savers and pensioners, and those that support them. The Code applies to: 1) asset owners such as pension schemes and insurers. 2) asset managers who manage assets on behalf of UK clients or invest in UK assets. 3) service providers such as investment consultants, proxy advisers, and data and research providers that support asset owners and asset managers to exercise their stewardship responsibilities.

"What is important to our clients and stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to anticipate and respond to"
"These factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate disclosures and sustainability- related content."
"Where we may refer to such terms, there is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies where these are considered. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve."
"Where we refer to screening processes, there is currently no market consensus, universally accepted framework (legal, regulatory or otherwise), criteria or purely objective way to select investments for sustainable strategies. We use multiple screening processes and analyse a number of factors in our investment selection process that we consider relevant in accordance with our internally defined criteria. Where we have referred to investment selection processes, these include subjective elements which require us to consider whether, on balance, a particular investment is appropriate for inclusion in a sustainable strategy based on our criteria, available information (including ESG data) and professional judgement. Further, ESG considerations are rapidly evolving and may vary by sector/industry, market trends, current science or academic thought, and the macro environment."

There is currently no universally accepted way of reporting, rating or categorising ESG data and so, where we may refer to, or rely on, third-party data, such data may be subject to certain limitations (including in relation to the quality, timeliness, completeness and availability of such ESG data).

The TCFD recommendations are a framework to help organisations more effectively disclose climate-related risks and opportunities. In this report, we provide detail on our climate- related governance, strategy, and risk management. The report also includes metrics and targets such as our exposure to sectors deemed at an elevated risk from climate change, and our capital markets activity in the carbon-related energy and extractive sectors.\nOur full TCFD Report can be found at: home.barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/\n2\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\nAppendix\n< >\nIntroduction\n3\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress\nChairman's letter to shareholders\nNigel Higgins Chairman\n4 2022\nCollaboration\nGovernance and risk management\nDear Shareholders,\nTwo years ago Barclays laid out a new climate approach in response to the climate crisis. We set out an ambition to become net zero by 2050, across all of our direct and indirect emissions, and we committed to align all of our financing activities with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. We made it clear at the time that we would approach the climate challenge thoughtfully and transparently, reporting to shareholders and other stakeholders and be accountable for our progress.\nThis document sets out our climate strategy and targets and reports on the progress which we have made. It also sets out those areas in which the bank has continued to evolve its approach. Probably most notably, Barclays is now committing to use the International Energy Agency's (IEA) 1.5\u00b0C-aligned scenario as its baseline for new targets. We have already set 2025 targets for Power and Energy, but we are now adding 2030 targets, and for Cement and Steel as well. We are also committing to phase out financing of thermal coal.\nLooking ahead\nAppendix\nWe took the decision a year ago that, at the 2022 Annual General Meeting, we would offer our shareholders a vote on our approach to climate change in the round. We have had discussions with several major shareholders and industry bodies over many months and are grateful for their input. It is not a simple task to address the climate challenge whilst also giving appropriate support to those companies which we believe are committed to the transition. We also respect legitimate concerns about energy security, energy poverty and the just transition. We hope that we have got the balance right. The appalling invasion of Ukraine has made it even more imperative to accelerate the energy transition, whilst imposing real challenges in achieving uniform year-on-year progress. Nonetheless, our commitment to our climate ambition and\nIt is not a simple task to address the climate challenge whilst also giving appropriate support to those companies which we believe are committed to the transition.\"\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\nAppendix\n<\nChairman's letter to shareholders\ncontinued\nShareholders and other stakeholders have challenged Barclays on its approach to the climate crisis and we have welcomed\nthe engagement. We hope you agree\nstrategy is unchanged and by next year we will be setting targets to cover more of the sectors we finance. We also anticipate recent events will accelerate the demand for investment in low-carbon energy infrastructure and capacity across the world and are determined to finance, on an even greater scale, the investment needed for transition.\nWe believe that our original championing of net zero and Paris alignment have made a difference in banking.\"\nthat our approach is both progressive and responsible. We believe that our original championing of net zero and Paris alignment has made a difference in banking. We have also ensured that our approach covers capital markets and contracted financing commitments as well as actual loans made. Clearly more needs to be done to extend this to the retail and consumer space, which is where policy leadership is so vital. We do hope that shareholders support the work that we have done so far and will support the Board on Resolution 26, recognising that, as always, there is more to be done.\nThere is much to be done to accelerate and improve the transition pathways. At the top of that list are coherent national approaches to energy policy, and ideally a global approach, setting clear targets and a clear timeframe for the decarbonisation of energy\nsupply, almost certainly involving some kind of carbon pricing and clear incentives to improve, for instance, domestic energy efficiency. The IEA's net zero scenario makes very clear our dependence on behavioural change and public policy changes to drive the necessary shift in the patterns of both demand and supply.\nBarclays puts considerable effort into both the expansion of its green and sustainable financing activities and the diminution in its fossil fuel financing. We also seek to contribute meaningfully to the improvement of policy and data capture and measurement. These are issues owned by the Board and discussed at the majority of Board meetings in 2021. They are also owned by senior management (10% of Executive Director remuneration is now tied to our progress in this field).\nNigelhysin Nigel Higgins Chairman\nWe would also like to see greater global coherence around taxonomies, data and measurement. We should not have different territorial ways of measuring a crisis that does not recognise national or regional boundaries.\n5\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress\nCEO introduction\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan Group Chief Executive, Barclays\n6\nCollaboration\nGovernance and risk management\nThe drive to net zero will be one of the defining issues of our lifetime, with implications for each one of our customers and clients. As the person entrusted with the leadership of this company, I am completely committed to bringing our ideas, our resources, our energy and our passion to achieving the net zero ambition for Barclays.\nFor the world to reach net zero emissions, three things are required. First is an enormous increase in low-carbon infrastructure and capacity, including renewable energy networks, and technology to improve energy efficiency, particularly in transportation, building heating and cooling and food production. Second is a co-ordinated and material diminution in carbon intensive activity, particularly fossil fuel consumption. Third is ambitious action to protect, enhance and restore natural ecosystems such as forests and oceans.\nIt is also important that the economic opportunities presented by an orderly transition are widely shared and available, particularly in developing countries. Realising a just and orderly transition of this kind will be a massive and complex global undertaking.\nLooking ahead\nAppendix\nIt is important that the economic opportunities presented by an orderly transition are widely shared and available, particularly in developing countries.'\nAs the IEA notes, limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C \"requires nothing short of a total transformation of the energy systems that underpin our economies.\"1 More and more countries and companies have announced targets to limit emissions, but the world is not yet on track to limit global warming to 1.5\u2103.\nTo achieve this ambitious goal, we must cooperate and coordinate globally across the public and private sectors. We need to establish common standards and transparent reporting, and to create the political and economic conditions for success.\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress\n2022\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress Collaboration\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\nAppendix\n> n\nCEO introduction continued\nToday, we are announcing a number of important updates to our approach. These include:\nWe want to be part of a financial system that works together to accelerate the transition, and we will engage constructively with\npolicymakers and others to address policy\nThere will also be a significant need for new investment. It is estimated that at least $3-5 trillion of additional investment will be required each year, for the next 30 years, in order to finance the transition.2 As a large global financial intermediary, Barclays has an important role in helping channel investment, including our own capital, into new green technologies and low-carbon infrastructure projects.

It will need to adapt to reflect market, technological, regulatory and geopolitical developments affecting the shape and timing of the transition to a low-carbon economy. We will keep our policies, targets and progress under review in light of the rapidly changing external environment and the need to support governments and clients in delivering an orderly energy transition and providing energy security. Progress may vary and we need to be able to adapt our approach to optimise the effectiveness and impact of our support for the transition, whilst remaining focused on our ambition of becoming a net zero bank by 2050.\nThis document sets out more detail on our strategy, our existing targets and progress to date.

We believe that Barclays can make the greatest difference by supporting our clients\nOur priority is, therefore, to support our customers and clients to transition. Consistent with our Purpose, our climate strategy and our approach to risk management, and to ensure that we achieve our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, where companies are unable or unwilling to reduce or eliminate their emissions, we will reduce our support over time. Such companies will find it increasingly difficult to access financing, including through Barclays. Since 2020, we have, for example, declined to provide financing to clients that have been unable to meet our existing policies in relation to thermal coal and oil sands.\nto transition to a low-carbon economy, rather than by simply phasing out support for them. This is particularly true for our clients in highly carbon-intensive sectors.\nThe trajectory for our clients' transition is influenced by a number of factors, including technological advancement, the public policy environment, behavioural change in society and the scale of change needed to adapt their business models. Client transition pathways will vary, even within the same sectors and geographies. We are developing a client transition framework to enable us to measure and monitor our clients' progress and seek opportunities to accelerate their progress through the provision of advice and financing solutions. This will help us to better understand their plans, the progress they are making to align with a 1.5\u2103 pathway, as well as their financing needs. The high-level framework, together with sector-based transition pathways, will allow us to more clearly understand how our clients' activities align with Barclays' net zero ambition and to identify and support their financing needs.\nExiting companies at this stage could push them to less transparent sources of funding, and to sources that may be significantly less supportive of the transition. Many highly carbon-intensive sectors require finance to transition, including Power, Energy, Cement, Steel, Transport and Materials. Restricting the flow of capital to these sectors could be harmful to the pace of the transition, limiting the real terms impact on global warming.\n12\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022\nOur targets and progress\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nCollaboration\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\nAppendix\n< >\nOur targets and progress\n13\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\n14\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\n1\nAchieving net zero operations\nWe are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with our operations and supply chain.\nOperational emissions by scope\nScope 3 Indirect\nScope 2 Indirect\nSuppliers\nWaste\nPurchase of energy to operate our facilities\nLeased assets\nBusiness travel\nScope 1 Direct\nFuel combustion\nFugitive emissions\nCompany cars\nProgress to date\nWe have been carbon neutral for our Scope 110, Scope 211 and Scope 3 business travel12 emissions since 2020. We have achieved this by reducing or eliminating sources of carbon dioxide emissions associated with our operations and business travel and by compensating any remaining emissions by purchasing carbon credits under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 86% since 2018 and we powered 94% of our operations with renewable electricity in 2021. More detail on our progress is set out in our TCFD Report available online: home. barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/ documents/investor-relations/reports- and-events/annual-reports/2021/ Barclays-TCFD-Report-2021.pdf.\n10.

Scope 2 emissions include our indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity and purchased steam and chilled water.\n12. Scope 3 business travel emissions are our indirect emissions from commercial air travel and other transport.\nAppendix\n<\nDefining net zero operations\nWe define net zero operations as the state in which we will achieve a GHG reduction of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by at least 90% against a 2018 baseline and use carbon removals to eliminate any residual operational emissions we cannot yet abate.\nWe are defining carbon neutral as first reducing carbon dioxide emissions then counterbalancing carbon dioxide emissions from Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel with carbon offsets.\nIn 2020, we disclosed that we were already net zero from our own operations based on the common acceptance at that time, that net zero and carbon neutral were interchangeable terms. To reflect the most recent interpretations of both these terms in public disclosure, we will make a distinction between net zero operations and carbon neutral in our disclosure from now on.\nUpstream, direct and downstream operational activities\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress\n2022 :unselected: :unselected: :unselected:\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nNext steps and new targets\nWe intend to remain carbon neutral for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel emissions, while investing in the continued decarbonisation of our operations and in the development of a net zero pathway for the emissions from our supply chain. We will continue to increase the share of renewable energy used, improve the energy efficiency of our buildings and data centres, progressively remove reliance on fossil fuel, reduce the level of waste we create, and minimise our emissions from business travel.\nWe are announcing a new target to achieve a 90% reduction in GHG emissions across Scopes 1 and 2 by 2025. We are also targeting 100% of renewable electricity procured by the end of 2025. In addition to using green tariff and energy attributes certificates to achieve this target, we aim to sign Power Purchase Agreements and increase on-site renewable energy generation.\nAn important part of our journey to achieve net zero will also be to address GHG emissions associated with the products and services we purchase, and to that end we have been working over the past few years with our key suppliers and the CDP13 to engage our supply chain and drive climate change transparency and action. We aim by 2025 for suppliers covering 70% of addressable spend to be disclosing their GHG emissions and have science-based emission reduction targets in place, and we aim to achieve net zero emissions in our supply chain well in advance of 2050.\n13.

In addition to internal reviews, we also undertake third-party review of the project portfolio from an independent voluntary carbon markets advisory firm, which is not directly involved in the sourcing process. All final projects must pass independent due diligence screening based on risk assessment in five key areas - location, technology, additionality, environmental/social impacts and environmental/social benefits. We firmly support initiatives to enhance the integrity and quality of the voluntary carbon markets including the work of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets. To achieve net zero operations we will look into procuring credits from a range of high-quality carbon removal solutions.\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress\n2022\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\n2\nReducing our financed emissions\nWe are committed to align all our financing to the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. In order to meet this ambition, we need to reduce the client emissions that we finance, not just for lending but for capital markets activities as well.\nPortfolio reduction\nTargets and progress to date\nIn November 2020, we set targets, informed by Paris-aligned benchmark scenarios, to reduce our financed emissions. We prioritised the Energy and Power sectors because they are responsible for up to three-quarters of all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions globally and because Barclays has meaningful exposure to them.\nWe set a target of 30% reduction in the CO2 intensity of our Power portfolio by 2025, as well as a target of 15% CO2 reduction in absolute emissions of our Energy portfolio by 2025. Both of these targets were set\n16\nagainst a December 2020 baseline, and both were aligned with the IEA's Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). We are one of only a small number of banks to set 2025 targets for Energy and Power, and one of a small number of our investment banking peers to have set an absolute emissions reduction target for Energy - effectively creating a 'carbon budget' for our Energy sector financing.\nWe have made solid progress against our targets. At December 2021, we had achieved an 8% reduction in Power CO, intensity and a 22% reduction in absolute financed emissions in Energy.\nHowever, it is important to note that progress towards our targets will likely be volatile and non-linear. This reflects a number of variables generally beyond our control. For example, progress may be impacted by geopolitical developments that result in energy supply pressures, such as the conflict in Ukraine, or by the varying pathways that individual companies take as a result of the technologies available to them to transition. In the short term, we may also experience decreases or increases in our metrics due to the volatility of the mix and volume of capital markets financing, or if issuance volumes increase significantly following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\nAppendix\n<\nOur current estimate of our clients' activities based on our disclosed methodology\nBlue Track\u2122 financed emissions - Energy Absolute emissions MtCO,\n100\n80\n-15% by 2025\n60\n40\nDecember 2021: 58.6 MtCO2\n20\n-22% since December 2020\nDecember 2020: 75.0 MtCO2\n0\n20202021\n2025\n2030\n2035\nIEA SDS Benchmark: OECD*\n2040\nBarclays progress\nBlue TrackTM financed emissions - Power Emissions intensity KgCO2/MWh\n350\n300\n-30% by 2025\n250\n200\nDecember 2021: 295.0 KgCO2/MWh\n150\n100\n-8% since December 2020\nDecember 2020: 320.0 KgCO2/MWh\n50\n0\n2020 2021\n2035\nIEA SDS Benchmark: OECD\n2025\n- Portfolio target path\n2030\n- Portfolio target path\n2040\nBarclays progress\nIn 2021, we continued to develop our methodology, including adding granularity and updated external client and industry data as it became available.

The Energy sector cannot reduce its carbon emissions intensity below a certain point (for instance, a barrel of oil cannot be decarbonised). Therefore, a reduction in absolute carbon emissions is the more appropriate measure for Energy.\n78.5 MtCO,e). This target includes an update in our methodology, to include\n17\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nIncorporating methane\nIn the Energy sector, we will now include methane emissions, in addition to CO. emissions. This will provide a more 2 granular and accurate measure of absolute emissions for Energy, where methane is a material gas emitted by upstream clients. Reducing methane emissions from this activity would have a measurable short- term effect on climate change and is economically and practically easy to abate in many circumstances. We include all GHG emissions, including methane, for Steel and Cement.\nMethane emissions are not as directly material in the Power sector. Therefore, we continue to measure only CO2 for our Power intensity target.\nUse of target ranges\nFor Energy, we have set an absolute emissions target, consistent with IEA NZE2050, which captures Scopes 1, 2 and 3 of the emissions of our clients. In the near term, we expect absolute reductions to be achieved through a combination of significant reductions in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by clients and some reduction in the provision of finance to higher emitting/higher risk clients. As our assessments of client transition plans and risk profiles become more granular, in the absence of declines in production levels as clients switch to renewable energy sources, we are likely to need to reduce the number of clients we support, or the quantum of financing we make available to them, to further reduce our absolute financed emissions, consistent with our strategy and management of risk. Reducing our absolute financed emissions in this way gives us greater control in our ability to achieve our target, so we have set a specific or spot\n18\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nBlue Track \u2122M\nOur approach to reducing our financed emissions is underpinned by Blue Track\u2122, a methodology we have developed for measuring our financed emissions and tracking them at a portfolio level against the goals of the Paris Agreement. Blue Track\u2122M builds on and extends existing industry approaches to cover not only lending, but also capital markets financing, setting us apart from many of our peers. This better reflects the breadth of our support for clients through our investment bank.\nBlue Track\u2122 starts by selecting an appropriate benchmark for a sector, which defines how financed emissions for a portfolio need to change over time in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We then determine how our sector portfolios are performing against these benchmarks: by estimating the emissions that our clients produce, determining how those emissions should be linked to the financing we provide, and then aggregating those measurements into a portfolio-level metric. This portfolio- level metric is then compared\ntarget for financed emission reduction in the Energy sector, rather than a range.\nFor Power, Cement and Steel, we have set emissions intensity targets and, as a result, we are using a target range. While we are clear what reduction is required to converge with the IEA NZE2050 pathway, we recognise there are additional dependencies and variables outside our\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\nto the benchmark. This approach allows us to make active choices to reshape our portfolio within our 'carbon limit' for each sector. This reflects our focus on transition and shows specifically how we are accelerating the shift from higher-carbon to lower-carbon activity. For this reason, Blue Track\u2122 does not currently take into account carbon offsets purchased at a client level or at a portfolio level.\nWe will continue to enhance and refine Blue Track\u2122M over time, including as climate data quality improves and as company disclosures become more granular. We continue to engage with peers to share our experience and many welcomed our level of transparency in relation to our methodology. We have also been pleased to hear that some have used Blue Track\u2122M to inform their own approach.\nMore details about Blue Track\u2122M are set out in our About Blue Track\u2122 whitepaper, available online: home. barclays/sustainability/addressing- climate-change/reducing-our- financed-emissions/bluetrack/\ncontrol that will determine the pace of the transition and therefore how quickly we are able to reduce our financed emissions intensity in these sectors:\n\" For each sector, the lower emissions reduction in the range reflects an estimated emissions reduction trajectory based on our current view of sector and client pathways and commitments;\nAppendix\n< >\n\" For each sector, the higher emissions reduction in the range is in line with the IEA NZE2050 pathway that is consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5\u2103. This pathway incorporates an assumption that public policy interventions, shifts in demand and new technologies will enable our clients to accelerate their transition plans beyond current commitments or expectations.\nTop-down portfolio assessment\nOur approach is to set granular targets for each sector within our financing portfolio. However, we recognise that it will take time to set targets for our entire portfolio using this approach, so we have started work to develop a high level, modelled assessment of our overall balance sheet emissions. This work will progress in 2022 and is consistent with the approach outlined by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), of which Barclays is a member.\nNext sectors in our target setting\nWe will continue to set targets for sectors in our financing portfolio. We will introduce targets for additional sectors in 2023 and 2024 and have already started work to set targets for Automotive Manufacturing and Residential Real Estate, which we will aim to announce in time for the 2022 Annual Report. The phasing of these announcements reflects the considerable work required to establish our baseline emissions for each sector and to set appropriate targets, taking account of both our lending and capital markets financing activities.\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022\nIntroduction\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nOur climate strategy\nRestrictive policies\nIn addition to setting sector-specific emission-reduction targets, we have set explicit restrictions to curtail or prohibit financing of certain activities and in sensitive sectors. These are summarised below and set out in detail in the Appendix. They include clear restrictions on thermal coal mining and coal-fired power generation, Arctic exploration and production, oil sands and hydraulic fracturing (fracking). Further restrictions are set out in our Position Statements in relation to Forestry and Agricultural Commodities and World Heritage and Ramsar Wetlands.\nThermal Coal\nToday, thermal coal is a climate risk and, increasingly, the financing of these activities is a credit risk.\nWe are committed to not providing any project finance for the construction or material expansion of coal-fired power plants or the development of greenfield thermal coal mines anywhere in the world. We are also committed to not providing general corporate financing that is specified as being for new or expanded coal mining or coal-fired power plant development.\nIn 2020, we introduced tightened restrictions on financing of thermal coal mining and coal-fired power generation. In particular, we set a limit on the amount of revenue which any entity may derive from thermal coal mining and/or power, progressively decreasing from 50% since 2020 to 30% by 2025, to 10% by 2030.\nNext steps and new announcements We are announcing a tightening of our thermal coal policy in a number of areas. In particular, we are introducing final phase- out dates for the financing of thermal coal mining and coal-fired power generation.\nThese vary by geography, as set out below, but the final phase out date for financing clients engaged in14 thermal coal mining or coal-fired power generation is 2035 (subject to limited exemptions as set out in the Appendix). Consistent with our intent to phase out thermal coal financing, from 2023 we will not extend financing to new clients engaged in thermal coal mining.\nFurther key changes in our thermal coal policy are:\nFor thermal coal mining:\n\u00b7 Bringing forward our existing plan to step down revenue thresholds, so that from 2023 we will not provide financing to existing clients that generate more than 30% of their revenue from thermal coal mining;\n\u00b7 Introducing phase out dates for entities engaged in thermal coal mining of 2030 in OECD and 2035 in the rest of the world;\n\u00b7 Introducing tighter restrictions on General Corporate Purposes (GCP) financing for clients engaged in opening new thermal coal mines or material expansion of existing thermal coal mines.\nFor coal-fired power generation, we are also introducing phase out dates, whilst recognising the different pace of power sector transition and legislation in different areas of the world:\n14. An entity is \"engaged in\" if it generates more than 5% of its revenue from the activity.\n19\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\n\" Introducing phase out dates for clients engaged in coal-fired power generation in the UK and EU by 2030, and in the rest of the world (including the USA) by 2035;\n\u00b7 Introducing tighter restrictions on General Corporate Purposes (GCP) financing for clients engaged in the development of new thermal coal-fired power plants or material expansion.\nThese restrictions build upon or in some cases replace existing restrictions. Our updated position is set out in detail in our Climate Change Statement - our approach to sensitive sectors, and available to read in the Appendix.\nUnconventional Oil & Gas\nIn 2020, we introduced tightened restrictions with a commitment not to directly finance oil and gas projects in the Arctic Circle nor to provide finance to companies we consider to be primarily engaged in these activities.\nWe will also not provide financing to ancillary Arctic oil and gas businesses where proceeds are known to be for supporting new oil and gas exploration, production, or new pipeline transportation projects in the Arctic Circle. We continue to enforce this policy.\nIn 2020, we strengthened our approach to the financing of oil sands. We will only provide financing to clients who have projects to reduce materially their overall emissions intensity, and a plan for the company as a whole to have lower emissions intensity than the level of the median global oil producer by the end of the decade. We continue to enforce this policy and have declined to\nAppendix\n>\nextend or renew financing to clients that are unable to commit to such plans or projects. In 2021, we reduced our lending exposure to clients in scope of our oil sands policy by approximately c.23% year-on-year.\nBarclays does not directly finance projects involving fracking in the UK and Europe, nor do we provide any financing to companies primarily engaged in fracking activities in the UK and Europe. Any financing of fracking outside of these regions is subject to enhanced due diligence, requiring clients and transactions to demonstrate consideration of environmental and social impacts and risks. We continue to enforce this policy.\nNew announcements on thermal coal financing\nA summary of our new announcements on thermal coal financing is also set out on page 11. For full details on our restrictive policies, please see the Appendix.\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress\n2022\nIntroduction\nLooking ahead\nAppendix\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nGovernance and risk management\n>\nOur approach to new investment in the Oil & Gas sector\nWe recognise that the transition to a low-carbon economy will require significant decline in oil and gas production. The IEA estimates that fossil fuels will need to decrease from 79% today to an estimated 22% of the world's energy supply by 2050 and, in its 'Net Zero Emissions by 2050: a Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector' report, it envisages no further new investment in fossil fuel supply projects. This is based on an assumption of significant deployment of clean and efficient energy technologies, including annual additions of solar PV and wind until 2030 that are four times higher than 2020 levels, as well as global energy efficiency improvements averaging 4% a year to 2030, which is around three times the average for the last 20 years. If these levels of investment are not achieved on a timely basis and/or geopolitical issues present additional challenges to near-term energy security, then governments may determine that new sources of oil and gas will continue to be required.\nWe also recognise that many of the companies engaged in new oil and gas projects are large, multinationals that are critical for the transition and actively engaged in it, committing significant resources and expertise to renewables, power infrastructure, EV networks and other essential elements of decarbonisation. Whilst these\n20\ncompanies are not yet on a 1.5\u2103-aligned pathway, they are developing strategies to ensure their continued relevance in and contribution to a low-carbon economy. Typically, these companies finance their exploration activities from cash flows rather than from project finance, so apart from exiting these client relationships completely, it would be impracticable for Barclays to try to impose restrictions on financing specific activities. To ensure a just and orderly transition our priority is to continue to engage with these clients rather than simply exit them.\nWe believe the financial services sector should take a considered approach to the IEA's assessment of future oil and gas requirements, taking a number of factors into account. These factors should include energy security; affordability; the ongoing need for substantial capital expenditure to provide the oil and gas still envisaged as being required in the IEA NZE scenario; the technical challenges of defining and monitoring reserves and production; and the ability of major energy companies to finance their activities from diverse sources of capital, including their balance sheets.\nBarclays will be participating in a number of industry working groups alongside peers over the coming months, some of which will look at credible and consistent\napproaches to transition pathways in sectors where targets are being prioritised by financial institutions, including oil and gas. This includes sector working groups of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), as well as the Sectoral Pathways group of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\n3\nFinancing the transition\nThe transition to a low- carbon economy is today's defining opportunity for innovation and growth. There is a significant opportunity for Barclays to play a leading role in helping to meet the demand for climate change related financing to support the transition. We are directing investment, including our own capital, into new green technologies and infrastructure projects that will build up low-carbon capacity and capability.\nTargets and progress to date\nIn 2018 we set a target to facilitate \u00a3100 billion of financing specifically focused on green activities by 2030. Since then, we have facilitated \u00a362.2 billion cumulative of financing for green activities, reflecting increasing demand for more innovative products, such as Sustainability Linked Loans and Bonds. In 2021, we facilitated \u00a329.8 billion of green financing, up 69% from \u00a317.6 billion in 2020.\nAll of our sustainable financing is tracked using the methodology set out in the Barclays Sustainable Finance Framework.\n\u00a362.2bn\nGreen financing facilitated since 2018.\nGovernance and risk management Looking ahead Appendix\nBarclays' green financing\n\u00a3100bn green financing (2018-2030)\n\u00a3bn :selected: Achieved to date :selected: Target by 2030\n\u00a362.2bn Green financing facilitated\n\u00a3bn\n2021\n2020\n14.8 :selected: Sustainability-linked (green) :unselected: Environmental\nBy region\n\u00a3bn\n2021\n12.7\n2020\n7.9 :selected: Americas :unselected: UK/Europe :unselected: Asia and Rest of the World\nBy product\n\u00a3bn\n2021\nK >\n62.24\n100.0\nTotal 29.84\n7.24\nTotal 17.6\n14.7\n2.4\n22.64\n2.8\n9.0\n0.7\n18.9\n4.4\n6.2\n2020\n12.2\n1.5\n3.8 :selected: Debt :unselected: Equity :unselected: Loan :unselected: Other: 2021: 0.3, 2020 :-\n4 2021 data reproduced from the Barclays PLC Annual Report subject to independent Limited Assurance under ISAE(UK)3000 and ISAE3410.

We expect to provide a further update later this year, including new and more granular green financing targets. We are supporting public policy efforts to develop a robust taxonomy to standardise green finance target setting in the financial services sector, against which we can align our green financing framework.\n\u00a3175m\nMandate to invest from our Sustainable Impact Capital Programme, of which we have invested \u00a354 million to date.\n22\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nInvesting directly in sustainability- focused start-ups\nOur Sustainable Impact Capital Programme has a mandate to invest up to \u00a3 175 million of equity capital in sustainability-focused start-ups by 2025, helping to accelerate our clients' transition towards a low-carbon economy.\nFrom the acceleration of innovative carbon-efficient technologies and supply chains to supporting the development of viable markets for carbon capture and sequestration, the Programme is seeking out and supporting clear, scalable propositions that deliver both environmental benefits and economic returns.\nThrough the Programme, we aim to fill growth stage funding gaps to help accelerate and scale catalytic and strategic solutions to environmental challenges.\nThe Programme has made meaningful progress towards its five year trajectory to meet our target by building a portfolio of strategic investments which have a focus on reducing carbon footprints and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy: \u00a354 million of the \u00a3175 million overall target has been deployed since 2020, with \u00a330 million invested in 2021, up 25% from 2020.\nIn 2022, the Programme will continue deploying capital to foster innovation to support Barclays' net zero ambition.\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\nThe role of nature and biodiversity\nNature and biodiversity are intrinsically connected to efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change and are vital to ensuring a sustainable economy and healthy society. The financial sector will have an important role to play in stewarding responsible finance and in supporting new financial flows for a nature-positive future. As a financial services institution, Barclays has relationships with customers and clients across a wide range of sectors and geographies, who face risks to their operations, supply chains and markets from biodiversity loss and land-use change. Recognising the importance of this agenda, we are developing our understanding and evaluating the Group's environmental impacts and dependencies as well as where we can support our clients through the transition to a nature- positive economy.\nAppendix\n< >\nCollaboration both within and across industries is essential to this transition. During 2021, Barclays became a member of the Taskforce on Nature- related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum and joined the Get Nature Positive initiative alongside other businesses to identify opportunities to take nature-positive action. Barclays also contributed to the development of emerging methodologies to assess nature-related impacts and dependencies at a portfolio level, including the Natural Capital Finance Alliance's ENCORE biodiversity module.\nDuring 2022, Barclays will progress this work and, in particular, our engagement with leading initiatives, with the aim of defining a comprehensive and robust approach to nature and biodiversity over time.\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\nAppendix\n< >\nCollaboration\n23 Barclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nWe believe that industry cooperation, particularly in setting common standards and transparent reporting, is important for all our stakeholders. We continue to engage with peers, industry experts and academics to assess the transition to a low-carbon economy and consider emerging methodologies and taxonomies.\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nWe also seek to work closely with governments in the geographies in which we operate, supporting the development of practical and ambitious policies where appropriate. Barclays supports the introduction of a carbon price, to incentivise the reduction of emissions across the economy. We have been early and active partners with the most consequential industry initiatives on climate change, which continue to define leading practice and help set standards. We are always mindful of ensuring our engagements are appropriate and consistent with relevant regulatory requirements.\nTrade associations\nWe endeavour to advance our climate change policy through the trade associations of which we are members. Many positions taken by trade associations result from negotiation and compromise among members with different or opposing views. We will contribute to these processes, seeking to influence how they evolve. Where a trade association's position on climate change does not align with our position, we will challenge it and otherwise seek to make our view clear. Barclays reserves the right to publicly dissent from a trade association's position. Should a trade association adopt a material position that is irreconcilable with our values or strategy, we are prepared to end our membership.\nGovernance and risk management\nLooking ahead\nAppendix\nK n\nSelected industry initiatives\nNet-Zero Banking Alliance\nIn 2021, Barclays was a founding member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.\nTask Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures\nBarclays has signed the statement of support of the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) TCFD since 2017.\nSustainable Markets Initiative\nBarclays is a member of HRH the Prince of Wales' Sustainable Markets Initiative's (SMI's) Financial Services Taskforce (FSTF) and is involved in both the Net Zero Emissions working group and the Carbon Offsetting working group.

The Board is also responsible for the oversight of social and environmental matters, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\nThe Group's climate strategy is reflected in the incentive arrangements for the Executive Directors of Barclays PLC. The annual bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) outcomes for the Executive Directors are based on a framework of performance measures and targets, set each year by the Remuneration Committee of the Barclays PLC Board. A proportion of the Executive Directors' bonus and LTIP awards each year are driven by strategic non-financial measures, which in both cases include measures relating to climate. For the 2022 bonus and 2022-2024 LTIP awards, 10% of the overall outcome for each will be determined by performance against climate and sustainability measures, reflecting our ambition to be net zero by 2050, including our commitment to align our financing with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nReflecting the increasing risks associated with climate change, and to support Barclays' ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, in 2020, the Board Risk Committee made the decision that climate risk would become a Principal Risk within the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) from 2022 to run alongside our other Principal Risk types.\nDuring 2021, the Board received four updates from the Group Head of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility and Group Head of Sustainability, covering matters including progress on our climate strategy, policy updates, industry trends, stakeholder engagement and target-setting. The Board also received regular updates on Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility matters (together with Group Reputation Risk Reports) from the Group Head of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility. These updates covered matters such as key government and regulatory policy, regulatory engagement and ESG matters including climate. In addition to these Board briefings, the Group Head of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility regularly engaged with the Barclays Group Chief Executive, Chairman and Non-Executive Directors on a range of matters relating to the Group's climate strategy. The chart on page 26 summarises Barclays' governance structure and the different responsibilities relating to climate change.\nTo support this decision, in 2021 the Barclays Group delivered a Climate Risk Integration Plan with three overarching objectives: \u00b7 Governance Framework: Develop a Principal Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement and integrate climate drivers into limit setting. \u00b7 Scenario Analysis: Refine methodologies used for the 2020 scenario analysis to support the Bank of England Biennial Exploratory Scenario on climate change, with specific focus on wholesale credit and physical risk modelling. \u00b7 Carbon Modelling: Enhance the Blue Track\u2122 model to further develop the approach for the Energy sector, expand coverage to Cement and Steel and consider the overall net zero ambition of the Barclays Group. Further information on our climate-related governance and approach to climate risk, including the use of scenario analysis, is set out in our TCFD Report.\n27\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress 2022 :selected: :unselected: :unselected: :selected: :selected: :selected:\nAppendix\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nGovernance and risk management Looking ahead\n< >\nLooking ahead\n28 2022\nBarclays' Climate Strategy, Targets and Progress\nLooking ahead\nIntroduction\nOur climate strategy\nOur targets and progress\nCollaboration\nGovernance and risk management\nAppendix\nK\nWe are still at an early stage in our journey.

"Dear Shareholders,"
"Two years ago Barclays laid"
"out a new climate approach"
"in response to the climate"
"crisis. We set out an ambition"
"to become net zero by 2050,"
"across all of our direct and"
"indirect emissions, and we"
"committed to align all of our"
"financing activities with the"
"goals and timelines of the"
"Paris Agreement. We made"
"it clear at the time that we"
"would approach the climate"
"challenge thoughtfully and"
"transparently, reporting"
"to shareholders and other"
"stakeholders and be"
"accountable for our progress."
"This document sets out our climate strategy"
"and targets and reports on the progress"
"which we have made. It also sets out those"
"areas in which the bank has continued"
"to evolve its approach. Probably most"
"notably, Barclays is now committing to use"
"the International Energy Agency's (IEA)"
"1.5\u00b0C-aligned scenario as its baseline for new"
"targets. We have already set 2025 targets"
"for Power and Energy, but we are now adding"
"2030 targets, and for Cement and Steel as"
"well. We are also committing to phase out"
"financing of thermal coal."
"Looking ahead"
"Appendix"
"We took the decision a year ago that, at"
"the 2022 Annual General Meeting, we"
"would offer our shareholders a vote on our"
"approach to climate change in the round."
"We have had discussions with several major"
"shareholders and industry bodies over many"
"months and are grateful for their input. It"
"is not a simple task to address the climate"
"challenge whilst also giving appropriate"
"support to those companies which we"
"believe are committed to the transition."
"We also respect legitimate concerns about"
"energy security, energy poverty and the"
"just transition. We hope that we have got"
"the balance right. The appalling invasion of"
"Ukraine has made it even more imperative"
"to accelerate the energy transition, whilst"
"imposing real challenges in achieving uniform"
"year-on-year progress. Nonetheless, our"
"commitment to our climate ambition and"
"It is not a simple task"
"to address the climate"
"challenge whilst also"
"giving appropriate"
"support to those"
"companies which we"
"believe are committed"
"to the transition.\""

"the climate crisis and we have welcomed"
"the engagement. We hope you agree"
"strategy is unchanged and by next year"
"we will be setting targets to cover more of"
"the sectors we finance. We also anticipate"
"recent events will accelerate the demand"
"for investment in low-carbon energy"
"infrastructure and capacity across the"
"world and are determined to finance, on an"
"even greater scale, the investment needed"
"for transition."
"We believe that"
"our original"
"championing of"
"net zero and Paris"
"alignment have"
"made a difference"
"in banking.\""
"that our approach is both progressive and"
"responsible. We believe that our original"
"championing of net zero and Paris alignment"
"has made a difference in banking. We have"
"also ensured that our approach covers"
"capital markets and contracted financing"
"commitments as well as actual loans made."
"Clearly more needs to be done to extend this"
"to the retail and consumer space, which is"
"where policy leadership is so vital."
"We do hope that shareholders support"
"the work that we have done so far and"
"will support the Board on Resolution 26,"
"recognising that, as always, there is more to"
"be done."
"There is much to be done to accelerate and"
"improve the transition pathways. At the top"
"of that list are coherent national approaches"
"to energy policy, and ideally a global"
"approach, setting clear targets and a clear"
"timeframe for the decarbonisation of energy"
"supply, almost certainly involving some"
"kind of carbon pricing and clear incentives"
"to improve, for instance, domestic energy"
"efficiency. The IEA's net zero scenario makes"
"very clear our dependence on behavioural"
"change and public policy changes to drive"
"the necessary shift in the patterns of both"
"demand and supply."
"Barclays puts considerable effort into"
"both the expansion of its green and"
"sustainable financing activities and the"
"diminution in its fossil fuel financing. We"
"also seek to contribute meaningfully to the"
"improvement of policy and data capture"
"and measurement. These are issues owned"
"by the Board and discussed at the majority"
"of Board meetings in 2021. They are also"
"owned by senior management (10% of"
"Executive Director remuneration is now tied"
"to our progress in this field)."
"Nigelhysin"
"Nigel Higgins"
"Chairman"
"We would also like to see greater global"
"coherence around taxonomies, data and"
"measurement. We should not have different"
"territorial ways of measuring a crisis that"
"does not recognise national or regional"
"boundaries."

"Working with our clients"
"All three elements of our"
"strategy are important,"
"but we recognise that the"
"majority of our carbon"
"emissions result from"
"the activities of the"
"clients we finance, known"
"as 'financed emissions'."
"We believe that Barclays can make the"
"greatest difference by supporting our clients"
"Our priority is, therefore, to support"
"our customers and clients to transition."
"Consistent with our Purpose, our"
"climate strategy and our approach to risk"
"management, and to ensure that we achieve"
"our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050,"
"where companies are unable or unwilling"
"to reduce or eliminate their emissions, we"
"will reduce our support over time. Such"
"companies will find it increasingly difficult to"
"access financing, including through Barclays."
"Since 2020, we have, for example, declined"
"to provide financing to clients that have"
"been unable to meet our existing policies in"
"relation to thermal coal and oil sands."
"to transition to a low-carbon economy,"
"rather than by simply phasing out support for"
"them. This is particularly true for our clients"
"in highly carbon-intensive sectors."
"The trajectory for our clients' transition is"
"influenced by a number of factors, including"
"technological advancement, the public policy"
"environment, behavioural change in society"
"and the scale of change needed to adapt"
"their business models. Client transition"
"pathways will vary, even within the same"
"sectors and geographies. We are developing"
"a client transition framework to enable us to"
"measure and monitor our clients' progress"
"and seek opportunities to accelerate their"
"progress through the provision of advice and"
"financing solutions. This will help us to better"
"understand their plans, the progress they"
"are making to align with a 1.5\u2103 pathway, as"
"well as their financing needs. The high-level"
"framework, together with sector-based"
"transition pathways, will allow us to more"
"clearly understand how our clients' activities"
"align with Barclays' net zero ambition and to"
"identify and support their financing needs."
"Exiting companies at this stage could push"
"them to less transparent sources of funding,"
"and to sources that may be significantly less"
"supportive of the transition. Many highly"
"carbon-intensive sectors require finance to"
"transition, including Power, Energy, Cement,"
"Steel, Transport and Materials. Restricting"
"the flow of capital to these sectors could be"
"harmful to the pace of the transition, limiting"
"the real terms impact on global warming."

"continued decarbonisation of our operations"
"and in the development of a net zero"
"pathway for the emissions from our supply"

"share of renewable energy used, improve"
"the energy efficiency of our buildings and"
"data centres, progressively remove reliance"
"on fossil fuel, reduce the level of waste we"
"create, and minimise our emissions from"
"business travel."
"We are announcing a new target to achieve"
"a 90% reduction in GHG emissions across"
"Scopes 1 and 2 by 2025. We are also targeting"
"100% of renewable electricity procured by the"
"end of 2025. In addition to using green tariff"
"and energy attributes certificates to achieve"
"this target, we aim to sign Power Purchase"
"Agreements and increase on-site renewable"
"energy generation."
"An important part of our journey to achieve"
"net zero will also be to address GHG"
"emissions associated with the products"
"and services we purchase, and to that"
"end we have been working over the past"
"few years with our key suppliers and the"
"CDP13 to engage our supply chain and drive"
"climate change transparency and action."
"We aim by 2025 for suppliers covering 70%"
"of addressable spend to be disclosing their"
"GHG emissions and have science-based"
"emission reduction targets in place, and we"
"aim to achieve net zero emissions in our"
"supply chain well in advance of 2050."

"Reducing our"
"financed emissions"
"We are committed to align"
"all our financing to the goals"
"and timelines of the Paris"
"Agreement. In order to meet"
"this ambition, we need to"
"reduce the client emissions"
"that we finance, not just"
"for lending but for capital"
"markets activities as well."
"Portfolio reduction"
"Targets and progress to date"
"In November 2020, we set targets, informed"
"by Paris-aligned benchmark scenarios,"
"to reduce our financed emissions. We"
"prioritised the Energy and Power sectors"
"because they are responsible for up to"
"three-quarters of all Greenhouse Gas (GHG)"
"emissions globally and because Barclays has"
"meaningful exposure to them."
"We set a target of 30% reduction in the CO2"
"intensity of our Power portfolio by 2025,"
"as well as a target of 15% CO2 reduction in"
"absolute emissions of our Energy portfolio"
"by 2025. Both of these targets were set"
"16"
"against a December 2020 baseline, and"
"both were aligned with the IEA's Sustainable"
"Development Scenario (SDS). We are one"
"of only a small number of banks to set 2025"
"targets for Energy and Power, and one of"
"a small number of our investment banking"
"peers to have set an absolute emissions"
"reduction target for Energy - effectively"
"creating a 'carbon budget' for our Energy"
"sector financing."
"We have made solid progress against our"
"targets. At December 2021, we had achieved"
"an 8% reduction in Power CO, intensity"
"and a 22% reduction in absolute financed"
"emissions in Energy."
"However, it is important to note that"
"progress towards our targets will likely"
"be volatile and non-linear. This reflects a"
"number of variables generally beyond our"
"control. For example, progress may be"
"impacted by geopolitical developments"
"that result in energy supply pressures, such"
"as the conflict in Ukraine, or by the varying"
"pathways that individual companies take"
"as a result of the technologies available to"
"them to transition. In the short term, we may"
"also experience decreases or increases in"
"our metrics due to the volatility of the mix"
"and volume of capital markets financing, or"
"if issuance volumes increase significantly"
"following the COVID-19 pandemic."

"Introduction"
"Our climate"
"strategy"
"Incorporating methane"
"In the Energy sector, we will now include"
"methane emissions, in addition to CO."
"emissions. This will provide a more"
"2"
"granular and accurate measure of absolute"
"emissions for Energy, where methane is a"
"material gas emitted by upstream clients."
"Reducing methane emissions from this"
"activity would have a measurable short-"
"term effect on climate change and is"
"economically and practically easy to abate"
"in many circumstances. We include all"
"GHG emissions, including methane, for"
"Steel and Cement."
"Methane emissions are not as directly"
"material in the Power sector. Therefore,"
"we continue to measure only CO2 for our"
"Power intensity target."
"Use of target ranges"
"For Energy, we have set an absolute"
"emissions target, consistent with IEA"
"NZE2050, which captures Scopes 1, 2 and 3"
"of the emissions of our clients. In the near"
"term, we expect absolute reductions to be"
"achieved through a combination of significant"
"reductions in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by"
"clients and some reduction in the provision of"
"finance to higher emitting/higher risk clients."
"As our assessments of client transition plans"
"and risk profiles become more granular, in the"
"absence of declines in production levels as"
"clients switch to renewable energy sources,"
"we are likely to need to reduce the number"
"of clients we support, or the quantum"
"of financing we make available to them,"
"to further reduce our absolute financed"
"emissions, consistent with our strategy and"
"management of risk. Reducing our absolute"
"financed emissions in this way gives us"
"greater control in our ability to achieve our"
"target, so we have set a specific or spot"
"18"
"Our targets"
"and progress"
"Collaboration"
"Blue Track \u2122M"
"Our approach to reducing our financed"
"emissions is underpinned by Blue Track\u2122,"
"a methodology we have developed for"
"measuring our financed emissions and"
"tracking them at a portfolio level against"
"the goals of the Paris Agreement."
"Blue Track\u2122M builds on and extends"
"existing industry approaches to cover"
"not only lending, but also capital"
"markets financing, setting us apart from"
"many of our peers. This better reflects"
"the breadth of our support for clients"
"through our investment bank."
"Blue Track\u2122 starts by selecting an"
"appropriate benchmark for a sector,"
"which defines how financed emissions"
"for a portfolio need to change over time"
"in line with the goals of the Paris"
"Agreement. We then determine how our"
"sector portfolios are performing against"
"these benchmarks: by estimating the"
"emissions that our clients produce,"
"determining how those emissions should"
"be linked to the financing we provide, and"
"then aggregating those measurements"
"into a portfolio-level metric. This"
"portfolio- level metric is then compared"
"target for financed emission reduction in the"
"Energy sector, rather than a range."
"For Power, Cement and Steel, we have"
"set emissions intensity targets and, as a"
"result, we are using a target range. While"
"we are clear what reduction is required"
"to converge with the IEA NZE2050"
"pathway, we recognise there are additional"
"dependencies and variables outside our"
"Governance and"
"risk management"
"Looking ahead"
"to the benchmark. This approach allows"
"us to make active choices to reshape our"
"portfolio within our 'carbon limit' for each"
"sector. This reflects our focus on"
"transition and shows specifically how"
"we are accelerating the shift from"
"higher-carbon to lower-carbon activity."
"For this reason, Blue Track\u2122 does not"
"currently take into account carbon"
"offsets purchased at a client level or"
"at a portfolio level."
"We will continue to enhance and refine"
"Blue Track\u2122M over time, including as"
"climate data quality improves and as"
"company disclosures become more"
"granular. We continue to engage with"
"peers to share our experience and many"
"welcomed our level of transparency in"
"relation to our methodology. We have"
"also been pleased to hear that some"
"have used Blue Track\u2122M to inform their"
"own approach."
"More details about Blue Track\u2122M are set"
"out in our About Blue Track\u2122"
"whitepaper, available online: home."
"barclays/sustainability/addressing-"
"climate-change/reducing-our-"
"financed-emissions/bluetrack/"
"control that will determine the pace of the"
"transition and therefore how quickly we"
"are able to reduce our financed emissions"
"intensity in these sectors:"
"\" For each sector, the lower emissions"
"reduction in the range reflects an"
"estimated emissions reduction trajectory"
"based on our current view of sector and"
"client pathways and commitments;"
"Appendix"
"<"
">"
"\" For each sector, the higher emissions"
"reduction in the range is in line with the"
"IEA NZE2050 pathway that is consistent"
"with limiting global warming to 1.5\u2103. This"
"pathway incorporates an assumption"
"that public policy interventions, shifts in"
"demand and new technologies will enable"
"our clients to accelerate their transition"
"plans beyond current commitments or"
"expectations."
"Top-down portfolio assessment"
"Our approach is to set granular targets for"
"each sector within our financing portfolio."
"However, we recognise that it will take time"
"to set targets for our entire portfolio using"
"this approach, so we have started work to"
"develop a high level, modelled assessment"
"of our overall balance sheet emissions."
"This work will progress in 2022 and is"
"consistent with the approach outlined by the"
"Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials"
"(PCAF), of which Barclays is a member."
"Next sectors in our target setting"
"We will continue to set targets for sectors"
"in our financing portfolio. We will introduce"
"targets for additional sectors in 2023 and"
"2024 and have already started work to set"
"targets for Automotive Manufacturing"
"and Residential Real Estate, which we"
"will aim to announce in time for the 2022"
"Annual Report. The phasing of these"
"announcements reflects the considerable"
"work required to establish our baseline"
"emissions for each sector and to set"
"appropriate targets, taking account of both"
"our lending and capital markets financing"
"activities."

"Restrictive policies"
"In addition to setting sector-specific"
"emission-reduction targets, we have set"
"explicit restrictions to curtail or prohibit"
"financing of certain activities and in sensitive"
"sectors. These are summarised below"
"and set out in detail in the Appendix. They"
"include clear restrictions on thermal coal"
"mining and coal-fired power generation,"
"Arctic exploration and production, oil"
"sands and hydraulic fracturing (fracking)."
"Further restrictions are set out in our"
"Position Statements in relation to Forestry"
"and Agricultural Commodities and World"
"Heritage and Ramsar Wetlands."
"Thermal Coal"
"Today, thermal coal is a climate risk and,"
"increasingly, the financing of these activities"
"is a credit risk."
"We are committed to not providing any"
"project finance for the construction or"
"material expansion of coal-fired power plants"
"or the development of greenfield thermal"
"coal mines anywhere in the world. We are"
"also committed to not providing general"
"corporate financing that is specified as being"
"for new or expanded coal mining or coal-fired"
"power plant development."
"In 2020, we introduced tightened restrictions"
"on financing of thermal coal mining and"
"coal-fired power generation. In particular,"
"we set a limit on the amount of revenue"
"which any entity may derive from thermal"
"coal mining and/or power, progressively"
"decreasing from 50% since 2020 to 30% by"
"2025, to 10% by 2030."
"Next steps and new announcements"
"We are announcing a tightening of our"
"thermal coal policy in a number of areas. In"
"particular, we are introducing final phase-"
"out dates for the financing of thermal coal"
"mining and coal-fired power generation."
"These vary by geography, as set out below,"
"but the final phase out date for financing"
"clients engaged in14 thermal coal mining"
"or coal-fired power generation is 2035"
"(subject to limited exemptions as set out in"
"the Appendix). Consistent with our intent to"
"phase out thermal coal financing, from 2023"
"we will not extend financing to new clients"
"engaged in thermal coal mining."
"Further key changes in our thermal coal"
"policy are:"
"For thermal coal mining:"
"\u00b7 Bringing forward our existing plan to step"
"down revenue thresholds, so that from"
"2023 we will not provide financing to existing"
"clients that generate more than 30% of"
"their revenue from thermal coal mining;"
"\u00b7 Introducing phase out dates for entities"
"engaged in thermal coal mining of 2030 in"
"OECD and 2035 in the rest of the world;"
"\u00b7 Introducing tighter restrictions on General"
"Corporate Purposes (GCP) financing for"
"clients engaged in opening new thermal"
"coal mines or material expansion of"
"existing thermal coal mines."
"For coal-fired power generation, we are"
"also introducing phase out dates, whilst"
"recognising the different pace of power"
"sector transition and legislation in different"
"areas of the world:"
"14. An entity is \"engaged in\" if it generates more than 5% of its revenue from the activity."

"Looking ahead"
"\" Introducing phase out dates for clients"
"engaged in coal-fired power generation in"

"\u00b7 Introducing tighter restrictions on General"
"Corporate Purposes (GCP) financing for"
"clients engaged in the development of"
"new thermal coal-fired power plants or"
"material expansion."
"These restrictions build upon or in some"
"cases replace existing restrictions. Our"
"updated position is set out in detail in our"
"Climate Change Statement - our approach"
"to sensitive sectors, and available to read in"
"the Appendix."
"Unconventional Oil & Gas"
"In 2020, we introduced tightened restrictions"
"with a commitment not to directly finance"
"oil and gas projects in the Arctic Circle nor to"
"provide finance to companies we consider to"
"be primarily engaged in these activities."
"We will also not provide financing to ancillary"
"Arctic oil and gas businesses where proceeds"
"are known to be for supporting new oil and"
"gas exploration, production, or new pipeline"
"transportation projects in the Arctic Circle."
"We continue to enforce this policy."
"In 2020, we strengthened our approach to"
"the financing of oil sands. We will only provide"
"financing to clients who have projects to"
"reduce materially their overall emissions"
"intensity, and a plan for the company as a"
"whole to have lower emissions intensity than"
"the level of the median global oil producer"
"by the end of the decade. We continue to"
"enforce this policy and have declined to"
"Appendix"
">"
"extend or renew financing to clients that are"
"unable to commit to such plans or projects."
"In 2021, we reduced our lending exposure"
"to clients in scope of our oil sands policy by"
"approximately c.23% year-on-year."
"Barclays does not directly finance projects"
"involving fracking in the UK and Europe, nor"
"do we provide any financing to companies"
"primarily engaged in fracking activities in the"
"UK and Europe. Any financing of fracking"
"outside of these regions is subject to"
"enhanced due diligence, requiring clients and"
"transactions to demonstrate consideration"
"of environmental and social impacts and"
"risks. We continue to enforce this policy."

"Our approach to new investment in the Oil & Gas sector"
"We recognise that the transition to"
"a low-carbon economy will require"
"significant decline in oil and gas"
"production. The IEA estimates that"
"fossil fuels will need to decrease from"
"79% today to an estimated 22% of"
"the world's energy supply by 2050 and,"
"in its 'Net Zero Emissions by 2050: a"
"Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector'"
"report, it envisages no further new"
"investment in fossil fuel supply projects."
"This is based on an assumption of"
"significant deployment of clean and"
"efficient energy technologies, including"
"annual additions of solar PV and wind"
"until 2030 that are four times higher"
"than 2020 levels, as well as global"
"energy efficiency improvements"
"averaging 4% a year to 2030, which"
"is around three times the average"
"for the last 20 years. If these levels of"
"investment are not achieved on a timely"
"basis and/or geopolitical issues present"
"additional challenges to near-term"
"energy security, then governments may"
"determine that new sources of oil and"
"gas will continue to be required."
"We also recognise that many of the"
"companies engaged in new oil and gas"
"projects are large, multinationals that"
"are critical for the transition and actively"
"engaged in it, committing significant"
"resources and expertise to renewables,"
"power infrastructure, EV networks and"
"other essential elements of"
"decarbonisation. Whilst these"
"20"
"companies are not yet on a 1.5\u2103-aligned"
"pathway, they are developing strategies"
"to ensure their continued relevance in"
"and contribution to a low-carbon"
"economy. Typically, these companies"
"finance their exploration activities from"
"cash flows rather than from project"
"finance, so apart from exiting these"
"client relationships completely, it would"
"be impracticable for Barclays to try to"
"impose restrictions on financing"
"specific activities. To ensure a just and"
"orderly transition our priority is to"
"continue to engage with these clients"
"rather than simply exit them."
"We believe the financial services sector"
"should take a considered approach to"
"the IEA's assessment of future oil and"
"gas requirements, taking a number of"
"factors into account. These factors"
"should include energy security;"
"affordability; the ongoing need for"
"substantial capital expenditure to provide"
"the oil and gas still envisaged as being"
"required in the IEA NZE scenario; the"
"technical challenges of defining and"
"monitoring reserves and production;"
"and the ability of major energy"
"companies to finance their activities"
"from diverse sources of capital, including"
"their balance sheets."
"Barclays will be participating in a number"
"of industry working groups alongside"
"peers over the coming months, some of"
"which will look at credible and consistent"
"approaches to transition pathways in sectors"
"where targets are being prioritised by financial"
"institutions, including oil and gas. This includes"
"sector working groups of the Net-Zero"
"Banking Alliance (NZBA), as well as the"
"Sectoral Pathways group of the Glasgow"
"Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ)."

"we are reviewing our sustainable financing"
"strategy and all green financing frameworks"
"and targets. We expect to provide a further"
"update later this year, including new and"

"Our Sustainable Impact Capital Programme"
"has a mandate to invest up to \u00a3 175 million"
"of equity capital in sustainability-focused"
"start-ups by 2025, helping to accelerate"
"our clients' transition towards a low-carbon"
"economy."
"From the acceleration of innovative"
"carbon-efficient technologies and supply"
"chains to supporting the development"
"of viable markets for carbon capture and"
"sequestration, the Programme is seeking out"
"and supporting clear, scalable propositions"
"that deliver both environmental benefits and"
"economic returns."
"Through the Programme, we aim to fill"
"growth stage funding gaps to help accelerate"
"and scale catalytic and strategic solutions to"
"environmental challenges."
"The Programme has made meaningful"
"progress towards its five year trajectory"
"to meet our target by building a portfolio"
"of strategic investments which have a"
"focus on reducing carbon footprints and"
"accelerating the transition to a low-carbon"
"economy: \u00a354 million of the \u00a3175 million"
"overall target has been deployed since 2020,"
"with \u00a330 million invested in 2021, up 25%"

"The role of nature and biodiversity"
"Nature and biodiversity are intrinsically"
"connected to efforts to mitigate"

"sustainable economy and healthy"
"society. The financial sector will have"
"an important role to play in stewarding"

"Barclays has relationships with"

"Our targets"
"and progress"
"Collaboration"
"We also seek to work closely with"
"governments in the geographies in which"
"we operate, supporting the development"
"of practical and ambitious policies"
"where appropriate. Barclays supports"
"the introduction of a carbon price, to"
"incentivise the reduction of emissions"
"across the economy."
"We have been early and active partners"
"with the most consequential industry"
"initiatives on climate change, which"
"continue to define leading practice and help"
"set standards. We are always mindful of"
"ensuring our engagements are appropriate"
"and consistent with relevant regulatory"
"requirements."
"Trade associations"
"We endeavour to advance our climate change policy through the trade associations"
"of which we are members. Many positions taken by trade associations result from"
"negotiation and compromise among members with different or opposing views. We"
"will contribute to these processes, seeking to influence how they evolve. Where a"
"trade association's position on climate change does not align with our position, we"
"will challenge it and otherwise seek to make our view clear. Barclays reserves the right"
"to publicly dissent from a trade association's position. Should a trade association"
"adopt a material position that is irreconcilable with our values or strategy, we are"
"prepared to end our membership."

"Reflecting the increasing risks associated"

"2020, the Board Risk Committee made the"

"to run alongside our other Principal Risk types."
"During 2021, the Board received four"

"matters including progress on our climate"
"strategy, policy updates, industry trends,"

"The Board also received regular updates on"
"Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility"
"matters (together with Group Reputation"
"Risk Reports) from the Group Head of"
"Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility."
"These updates covered matters such as"
"key government and regulatory policy,"

"Glossary"
"Term"
"Explanation"
"Absolute emissions"
"Emissions of any greenhouse gases generated from actions, expressed in absolute terms (e.g. tonnes of CO2 or tonnes"
"of CO2e)"
"Blue Track\u2122M"
"Blue Track\u2122 is Barclays' methodology for measuring financed emissions, and tracking them at a portfolio level against the"
"goals of the Paris Agreement. Blue Track\u2122 includes capital markets financing in addition to lending"
"Carbon neutral"
"We are defining carbon neutral as first reducing carbon dioxide emissions then counterbalancing carbon dioxide emissions"
"from Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel with carbon offsets"
"Carbon removals"
"The action of removing GHG emissions from the atmosphere and store it through various means, such as in soils, trees,"
"underground reservoirs, rocks, the oceans, and even products like concrete and carbon fibre"
"Emissions intensity"
"Absolute Emissions expressed per a specific unit (e.g. tCO, e/\u20acM invested or lent, tCO2 e/MWh produced, tCO2 e/ton"
"product produced, tCO2 e/MWh produced, tCO2 e/ton product produced, tCO2 e/\u20acM company revenue)"
"Financed emissions"
"Emissions that banks and investors finance through their loans and investments"
"Greenhouse Gas (GHG)"
"The GHG protocol defines GHGs as the six gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol: carbon dioxide (CO2); methane (CH2);"
"nitrous oxide (N2O); hydroflourocarbons (HFCs); perflourocarbons (PFCs); and sulphur hexaflouride (SF )"
"Paris Agreement"
"The Paris Agreement is a legally-binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 parties at COP21"
"in Paris. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2\u2103, preferably to 1.5\u2103, compared to pre-industrial levels"
"Renewables"
"Energy taken from sources that are inexhaustible, e.g. wind, water, solar, geothermal energy, and biofuels"
"Scenario analysis"
"Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change are without historical precedent. Forward-looking analyses, such as"
"scenario analysis, can help organisations consider a broader range of assumptions, uncertainties, and potential future"
"states when assessing financial implications of climate change"
"Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs)"
"In the UK, Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) are currently defined as having less than 75 grams of CO2 per kilometre"
"(g/km) from the tail pipe (Source: https://carfueldata.vehicle-certification-agency.gov.uk/additional/2021/2021%20"

"Shareholders and other stakeholders have challenged Barclays on its approach to the climate crisis and we have welcomed"
""
""
"strategy is unchanged and by next year we will be setting targets to cover more of the sectors we finance. We also anticipate recent events will accelerate the demand for investment in low-carbon energy infrastructure and capacity across the world and are determined to finance, on an even greater scale, the investment needed for transition."
"We believe that our original championing of net zero and Paris alignment have made a difference in banking.\""
"the engagement. We hope you agree\nthat our approach is both progressive and responsible. We believe that our original championing of net zero and Paris alignment has made a difference in banking. We have also ensured that our approach covers capital markets and contracted financing commitments as well as actual loans made. Clearly more needs to be done to extend this to the retail and consumer space, which is where policy leadership is so vital. We do hope that shareholders support the work that we have done so far and will support the Board on Resolution 26, recognising that, as always, there is more to be done."
""
""
"There is much to be done to accelerate and improve the transition pathways. At the top of that list are coherent national approaches to energy policy, and ideally a global approach, setting clear targets and a clear timeframe for the decarbonisation of energy"
""
""
"supply, almost certainly involving some kind of carbon pricing and clear incentives to improve, for instance, domestic energy efficiency. The IEA's net zero scenario makes very clear our dependence on behavioural change and public policy changes to drive the necessary shift in the patterns of both demand and supply."
"Barclays puts considerable effort into both the expansion of its green and sustainable financing activities and the diminution in its fossil fuel financing. We also seek to contribute meaningfully to the improvement of policy and data capture and measurement. These are issues owned by the Board and discussed at the majority of Board meetings in 2021. They are also owned by senior management (10% of Executive Director remuneration is now tied to our progress in this field)."
"Nigelhysin Nigel Higgins Chairman"
""
""
""
"We would also like to see greater global coherence around taxonomies, data and measurement. We should not have different territorial ways of measuring a crisis that does not recognise national or regional boundaries."
"CEO introduction continued"

"We want to be part of a financial system that works together to accelerate the transition, and we will engage constructively with"

"There will also be a significant need for new investment. It is estimated that at least $3-5 trillion of additional investment will be required each year, for the next 30 years, in order to finance the transition.2 As a large global financial intermediary, Barclays has an important role in helping channel investment, including our own capital, into new green technologies and low-carbon infrastructure projects.

"Working with our clients"
"All three elements of our strategy are important, but we recognise that the majority of our carbon emissions result from the activities of the clients we finance, known as 'financed emissions'. We believe that Barclays can make the greatest difference by supporting our clients"
"Our priority is, therefore, to support our customers and clients to transition. Consistent with our Purpose, our climate strategy and our approach to risk management, and to ensure that we achieve our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, where companies are unable or unwilling to reduce or eliminate their emissions, we will reduce our support over time. Such companies will find it increasingly difficult to access financing, including through Barclays. Since 2020, we have, for example, declined to provide financing to clients that have been unable to meet our existing policies in relation to thermal coal and oil sands."
""
"to transition to a low-carbon economy, rather than by simply phasing out support for them. This is particularly true for our clients in highly carbon-intensive sectors."
"The trajectory for our clients' transition is influenced by a number of factors, including technological advancement, the public policy environment, behavioural change in society and the scale of change needed to adapt their business models. Client transition pathways will vary, even within the same sectors and geographies. We are developing a client transition framework to enable us to measure and monitor our clients' progress and seek opportunities to accelerate their progress through the provision of advice and financing solutions. This will help us to better understand their plans, the progress they are making to align with a 1.5\u2103 pathway, as well as their financing needs. The high-level framework, together with sector-based transition pathways, will allow us to more clearly understand how our clients' activities align with Barclays' net zero ambition and to identify and support their financing needs."
""
"Exiting companies at this stage could push them to less transparent sources of funding, and to sources that may be significantly less supportive of the transition. Many highly carbon-intensive sectors require finance to transition, including Power, Energy, Cement, Steel, Transport and Materials. Restricting the flow of capital to these sectors could be harmful to the pace of the transition, limiting the real terms impact on global warming."

"Explanation"
"Absolute emissions"
"Emissions of any greenhouse gases generated from actions, expressed in absolute terms (e.g. tonnes of CO2 or tonnes of CO2e)"
"Blue Track\u2122M"
"Blue Track\u2122 is Barclays' methodology for measuring financed emissions, and tracking them at a portfolio level against the goals of the Paris Agreement. Blue Track\u2122 includes capital markets financing in addition to lending"
"Carbon neutral"
"We are defining carbon neutral as first reducing carbon dioxide emissions then counterbalancing carbon dioxide emissions from Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel with carbon offsets"
"Carbon removals"
"The action of removing GHG emissions from the atmosphere and store it through various means, such as in soils, trees, underground reservoirs, rocks, the oceans, and even products like concrete and carbon fibre"
"Emissions intensity"
"Absolute Emissions expressed per a specific unit (e.g. tCO, e/\u20acM invested or lent, tCO2 e/MWh produced, tCO2 e/ton product produced, tCO2 e/MWh produced, tCO2 e/ton product produced, tCO2 e/\u20acM company revenue)"
"Financed emissions"
"Emissions that banks and investors finance through their loans and investments"
"Greenhouse Gas (GHG)"
"The GHG protocol defines GHGs as the six gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol: carbon dioxide (CO2); methane (CH2); nitrous oxide (N2O); hydroflourocarbons (HFCs); perflourocarbons (PFCs); and sulphur hexaflouride (SF )"
"Paris Agreement"
"The Paris Agreement is a legally-binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 parties at COP21 in Paris. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2\u2103, preferably to 1.5\u2103, compared to pre-industrial levels"
"Renewables"
"Energy taken from sources that are inexhaustible, e.g. wind, water, solar, geothermal energy, and biofuels"
"Scenario analysis"
"Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change are without historical precedent. Forward-looking analyses, such as scenario analysis, can help organisations consider a broader range of assumptions, uncertainties, and potential future states when assessing financial implications of climate change"
"Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs)"
"In the UK, Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) are currently defined as having less than 75 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km) from the tail pipe (Source: https://carfueldata.vehicle-certification-agency.gov.uk/additional/2021/2021%20 Booklet.pdf). Definitions may differ slightly in other jurisdictions but the term generally refers to vehicles that use low carbon technologies"

"Dear Shareholders,"
"Two years ago Barclays laid out a new climate approach in response to the climate crisis. We set out an ambition to become net zero by 2050, across all of our direct and indirect emissions, and we committed to align all of our financing activities with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. We made it clear at the time that we would approach the climate challenge thoughtfully and transparently, reporting to shareholders and other stakeholders and be accountable for our progress."
"This document sets out our climate strategy and targets and reports on the progress which we have made. It also sets out those areas in which the bank has continued to evolve its approach. Probably most notably, Barclays is now committing to use the International Energy Agency's (IEA) 1.5\u00b0C-aligned scenario as its baseline for new targets. We have already set 2025 targets for Power and Energy, but we are now adding 2030 targets, and for Cement and Steel as well. We are also committing to phase out financing of thermal coal."
"Looking ahead"
"Appendix"
"We took the decision a year ago that, at the 2022 Annual General Meeting, we would offer our shareholders a vote on our approach to climate change in the round. We have had discussions with several major shareholders and industry bodies over many months and are grateful for their input. It is not a simple task to address the climate challenge whilst also giving appropriate support to those companies which we believe are committed to the transition. We also respect legitimate concerns about energy security, energy poverty and the just transition. We hope that we have got the balance right. The appalling invasion of Ukraine has made it even more imperative to accelerate the energy transition, whilst imposing real challenges in achieving uniform year-on-year progress. Nonetheless, our commitment to our climate ambition and"

"Shareholders and other stakeholders have challenged Barclays on its approach to the climate crisis and we have welcomed"
"strategy is unchanged and by next year we will be setting targets to cover more of the sectors we finance. We also anticipate recent events will accelerate the demand for investment in low-carbon energy infrastructure and capacity across the world and are determined to finance, on an even greater scale, the investment needed for transition."
"We believe that our original championing of net zero and Paris alignment have made a difference in banking.\""
"the engagement. We hope you agree\nthat our approach is both progressive and responsible. We believe that our original championing of net zero and Paris alignment has made a difference in banking. We have also ensured that our approach covers capital markets and contracted financing commitments as well as actual loans made. Clearly more needs to be done to extend this to the retail and consumer space, which is where policy leadership is so vital. We do hope that shareholders support the work that we have done so far and will support the Board on Resolution 26, recognising that, as always, there is more to be done."
"There is much to be done to accelerate and improve the transition pathways. At the top of that list are coherent national approaches to energy policy, and ideally a global approach, setting clear targets and a clear timeframe for the decarbonisation of energy"
"supply, almost certainly involving some kind of carbon pricing and clear incentives to improve, for instance, domestic energy efficiency. The IEA's net zero scenario makes very clear our dependence on behavioural change and public policy changes to drive the necessary shift in the patterns of both demand and supply."
"Barclays puts considerable effort into both the expansion of its green and sustainable financing activities and the diminution in its fossil fuel financing. We also seek to contribute meaningfully to the improvement of policy and data capture and measurement. These are issues owned by the Board and discussed at the majority of Board meetings in 2021. They are also owned by senior management (10% of Executive Director remuneration is now tied to our progress in this field)."
"Nigelhysin Nigel Higgins Chairman"
"We would also like to see greater global coherence around taxonomies, data and measurement. We should not have different territorial ways of measuring a crisis that does not recognise national or regional boundaries."

"The drive to net zero will be one of the defining issues of our lifetime, with implications for each one of our customers and clients. As the person entrusted with the leadership of this company, I am completely committed to bringing our ideas, our resources, our energy and our passion to achieving the net zero ambition for Barclays."
"For the world to reach net zero emissions, three things are required. First is an enormous increase in low-carbon infrastructure and capacity, including renewable energy networks, and technology to improve energy efficiency, particularly in transportation, building heating and cooling and food production. Second is a co-ordinated and material diminution in carbon intensive activity, particularly fossil fuel consumption. Third is ambitious action to protect, enhance and restore natural ecosystems such as forests and oceans."
"It is also important that the economic opportunities presented by an orderly transition are widely shared and available, particularly in developing countries. Realising a just and orderly transition of this kind will be a massive and complex global undertaking."
"Looking ahead"
"Appendix"
"It is important that the economic opportunities presented by an orderly transition are widely shared and available, particularly in developing countries.'"
"As the IEA notes, limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C \"requires nothing short of a total transformation of the energy systems that underpin our economies.\"1 More and more countries and companies have announced targets to limit emissions, but the world is not yet on track to limit global warming to 1.5\u2103."
"To achieve this ambitious goal, we must cooperate and coordinate globally across the public and private sectors. We need to establish common standards and transparent reporting, and to create the political and economic conditions for success."

"Working with our clients"
"All three elements of our strategy are important, but we recognise that the majority of our carbon emissions result from the activities of the clients we finance, known as 'financed emissions'. We believe that Barclays can make the greatest difference by supporting our clients"
"Our priority is, therefore, to support our customers and clients to transition. Consistent with our Purpose, our climate strategy and our approach to risk management, and to ensure that we achieve our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, where companies are unable or unwilling to reduce or eliminate their emissions, we will reduce our support over time. Such companies will find it increasingly difficult to access financing, including through Barclays. Since 2020, we have, for example, declined to provide financing to clients that have been unable to meet our existing policies in relation to thermal coal and oil sands."
"to transition to a low-carbon economy, rather than by simply phasing out support for them. This is particularly true for our clients in highly carbon-intensive sectors."
"The trajectory for our clients' transition is influenced by a number of factors, including technological advancement, the public policy environment, behavioural change in society and the scale of change needed to adapt their business models. Client transition pathways will vary, even within the same sectors and geographies. We are developing a client transition framework to enable us to measure and monitor our clients' progress and seek opportunities to accelerate their progress through the provision of advice and financing solutions. This will help us to better understand their plans, the progress they are making to align with a 1.5\u2103 pathway, as well as their financing needs. The high-level framework, together with sector-based transition pathways, will allow us to more clearly understand how our clients' activities align with Barclays' net zero ambition and to identify and support their financing needs."
"Exiting companies at this stage could push them to less transparent sources of funding, and to sources that may be significantly less supportive of the transition. Many highly carbon-intensive sectors require finance to transition, including Power, Energy, Cement, Steel, Transport and Materials. Restricting the flow of capital to these sectors could be harmful to the pace of the transition, limiting the real terms impact on global warming."

"We have been carbon neutral for our Scope 110, Scope 211 and Scope 3 business travel12 emissions since 2020. We have achieved this by reducing or eliminating sources of carbon dioxide emissions associated with our operations and business travel and by compensating any remaining emissions by purchasing carbon credits under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 86% since 2018 and we powered 94% of our operations with renewable electricity in 2021. More detail on our progress is set out in our TCFD Report available online: home. barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/ documents/investor-relations/reports- and-events/annual-reports/2021/ Barclays-TCFD-Report-2021.pdf."

"Defining net zero operations"
"We define net zero operations as the state in which we will achieve a GHG reduction of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by at least 90% against a 2018 baseline and use carbon removals to eliminate any residual operational emissions we cannot yet abate."
"We are defining carbon neutral as first reducing carbon dioxide emissions then counterbalancing carbon dioxide emissions from Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel with carbon offsets."
"In 2020, we disclosed that we were already net zero from our own operations based on the common acceptance at that time, that net zero and carbon neutral were interchangeable terms. To reflect the most recent interpretations of both these terms in public disclosure, we will make a distinction between net zero operations and carbon neutral in our disclosure from now on."

"Our climate strategy"
"Next steps and new targets"
"We intend to remain carbon neutral for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel emissions, while investing in the continued decarbonisation of our operations and in the development of a net zero pathway for the emissions from our supply chain. We will continue to increase the share of renewable energy used, improve the energy efficiency of our buildings and data centres, progressively remove reliance on fossil fuel, reduce the level of waste we create, and minimise our emissions from business travel."
"We are announcing a new target to achieve a 90% reduction in GHG emissions across Scopes 1 and 2 by 2025. We are also targeting 100% of renewable electricity procured by the end of 2025. In addition to using green tariff and energy attributes certificates to achieve this target, we aim to sign Power Purchase Agreements and increase on-site renewable energy generation."
"An important part of our journey to achieve net zero will also be to address GHG emissions associated with the products and services we purchase, and to that end we have been working over the past few years with our key suppliers and the CDP13 to engage our supply chain and drive climate change transparency and action. We aim by 2025 for suppliers covering 70% of addressable spend to be disclosing their GHG emissions and have science-based emission reduction targets in place, and we aim to achieve net zero emissions in our supply chain well in advance of 2050."

"We conduct due diligence as part of our procurement of carbon offsets."
"We have invested in a portfolio of credits, under the VCS, that come from approved methodologies. In addition to internal reviews, we also undertake third-party review of the project portfolio from an independent voluntary carbon markets advisory firm, which is not directly involved in the sourcing process. All final projects must pass independent due diligence screening based on risk assessment in five key areas - location, technology, additionality, environmental/social impacts and environmental/social benefits. We firmly support initiatives to enhance the integrity and quality of the voluntary carbon markets including the work of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets. To achieve net zero operations we will look into procuring credits from a range of high-quality carbon removal solutions."

"Reducing our financed emissions"
"We are committed to align all our financing to the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. In order to meet this ambition, we need to reduce the client emissions that we finance, not just for lending but for capital markets activities as well."
"Portfolio reduction"
"Targets and progress to date"
"In November 2020, we set targets, informed by Paris-aligned benchmark scenarios, to reduce our financed emissions. We prioritised the Energy and Power sectors because they are responsible for up to three-quarters of all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions globally and because Barclays has meaningful exposure to them."
"We set a target of 30% reduction in the CO2 intensity of our Power portfolio by 2025, as well as a target of 15% CO2 reduction in absolute emissions of our Energy portfolio by 2025. Both of these targets were set"
"16"
"against a December 2020 baseline, and both were aligned with the IEA's Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). We are one of only a small number of banks to set 2025 targets for Energy and Power, and one of a small number of our investment banking peers to have set an absolute emissions reduction target for Energy - effectively creating a 'carbon budget' for our Energy sector financing."
"We have made solid progress against our targets. At December 2021, we had achieved an 8% reduction in Power CO, intensity and a 22% reduction in absolute financed emissions in Energy."
"However, it is important to note that progress towards our targets will likely be volatile and non-linear. This reflects a number of variables generally beyond our control. For example, progress may be impacted by geopolitical developments that result in energy supply pressures, such as the conflict in Ukraine, or by the varying pathways that individual companies take as a result of the technologies available to them to transition. In the short term, we may also experience decreases or increases in our metrics due to the volatility of the mix and volume of capital markets financing, or if issuance volumes increase significantly following the COVID-19 pandemic."

"Introduction"
"Our climate strategy"
"Incorporating methane"
"In the Energy sector, we will now include methane emissions, in addition to CO. emissions. This will provide a more 2 granular and accurate measure of absolute emissions for Energy, where methane is a material gas emitted by upstream clients. Reducing methane emissions from this activity would have a measurable short- term effect on climate change and is economically and practically easy to abate in many circumstances. We include all GHG emissions, including methane, for Steel and Cement."
"Methane emissions are not as directly material in the Power sector. Therefore, we continue to measure only CO2 for our Power intensity target."
"Use of target ranges"
"For Energy, we have set an absolute emissions target, consistent with IEA NZE2050, which captures Scopes 1, 2 and 3 of the emissions of our clients. In the near term, we expect absolute reductions to be achieved through a combination of significant reductions in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by clients and some reduction in the provision of finance to higher emitting/higher risk clients. As our assessments of client transition plans and risk profiles become more granular, in the absence of declines in production levels as clients switch to renewable energy sources, we are likely to need to reduce the number of clients we support, or the quantum of financing we make available to them, to further reduce our absolute financed emissions, consistent with our strategy and management of risk. Reducing our absolute financed emissions in this way gives us greater control in our ability to achieve our target, so we have set a specific or spot"

"Blue Track \u2122M"
"Our approach to reducing our financed emissions is underpinned by Blue Track\u2122, a methodology we have developed for measuring our financed emissions and tracking them at a portfolio level against the goals of the Paris Agreement. Blue Track\u2122M builds on and extends existing industry approaches to cover not only lending, but also capital markets financing, setting us apart from many of our peers. This better reflects the breadth of our support for clients through our investment bank."
"Blue Track\u2122 starts by selecting an appropriate benchmark for a sector, which defines how financed emissions for a portfolio need to change over time in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We then determine how our sector portfolios are performing against these benchmarks: by estimating the emissions that our clients produce, determining how those emissions should be linked to the financing we provide, and then aggregating those measurements into a portfolio-level metric.

This reflects our focus on transition and shows specifically how we are accelerating the shift from higher-carbon to lower-carbon activity. For this reason, Blue Track\u2122 does not currently take into account carbon offsets purchased at a client level or at a portfolio level."
"We will continue to enhance and refine Blue Track\u2122M over time, including as climate data quality improves and as company disclosures become more granular. We continue to engage with peers to share our experience and many welcomed our level of transparency in relation to our methodology.

This pathway incorporates an assumption that public policy interventions, shifts in demand and new technologies will enable our clients to accelerate their transition plans beyond current commitments or expectations."
"Top-down portfolio assessment"
"Our approach is to set granular targets for each sector within our financing portfolio. However, we recognise that it will take time to set targets for our entire portfolio using this approach, so we have started work to develop a high level, modelled assessment of our overall balance sheet emissions. This work will progress in 2022 and is consistent with the approach outlined by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), of which Barclays is a member."
"Next sectors in our target setting"
"We will continue to set targets for sectors in our financing portfolio. We will introduce targets for additional sectors in 2023 and 2024 and have already started work to set targets for Automotive Manufacturing and Residential Real Estate, which we will aim to announce in time for the 2022 Annual Report. The phasing of these announcements reflects the considerable work required to establish our baseline emissions for each sector and to set appropriate targets, taking account of both our lending and capital markets financing activities."

"Restrictive policies"
"In addition to setting sector-specific emission-reduction targets, we have set explicit restrictions to curtail or prohibit financing of certain activities and in sensitive sectors. These are summarised below and set out in detail in the Appendix. They include clear restrictions on thermal coal mining and coal-fired power generation, Arctic exploration and production, oil sands and hydraulic fracturing (fracking). Further restrictions are set out in our Position Statements in relation to Forestry and Agricultural Commodities and World Heritage and Ramsar Wetlands."
"Thermal Coal"
"Today, thermal coal is a climate risk and, increasingly, the financing of these activities is a credit risk."
"We are committed to not providing any project finance for the construction or material expansion of coal-fired power plants or the development of greenfield thermal coal mines anywhere in the world. We are also committed to not providing general corporate financing that is specified as being for new or expanded coal mining or coal-fired power plant development."
"In 2020, we introduced tightened restrictions on financing of thermal coal mining and coal-fired power generation. In particular, we set a limit on the amount of revenue which any entity may derive from thermal coal mining and/or power, progressively decreasing from 50% since 2020 to 30% by 2025, to 10% by 2030."
"Next steps and new announcements We are announcing a tightening of our thermal coal policy in a number of areas. In particular, we are introducing final phase- out dates for the financing of thermal coal mining and coal-fired power generation."
"These vary by geography, as set out below, but the final phase out date for financing clients engaged in14 thermal coal mining or coal-fired power generation is 2035 (subject to limited exemptions as set out in the Appendix). Consistent with our intent to phase out thermal coal financing, from 2023 we will not extend financing to new clients engaged in thermal coal mining."
"Further key changes in our thermal coal policy are:"
"For thermal coal mining:"
"\u00b7 Bringing forward our existing plan to step down revenue thresholds, so that from 2023 we will not provide financing to existing clients that generate more than 30% of their revenue from thermal coal mining;"
"\u00b7 Introducing phase out dates for entities engaged in thermal coal mining of 2030 in OECD and 2035 in the rest of the world;"
"\u00b7 Introducing tighter restrictions on General Corporate Purposes (GCP) financing for clients engaged in opening new thermal coal mines or material expansion of existing thermal coal mines."
"For coal-fired power generation, we are also introducing phase out dates, whilst recognising the different pace of power sector transition and legislation in different areas of the world:"
"14. An entity is \"engaged in\" if it generates more than 5% of its revenue from the activity."
"19"
"Governance and risk management"

"\" Introducing phase out dates for clients engaged in coal-fired power generation in the UK and EU by 2030, and in the rest of the world (including the USA) by 2035;"
"\u00b7 Introducing tighter restrictions on General Corporate Purposes (GCP) financing for clients engaged in the development of new thermal coal-fired power plants or material expansion."
"These restrictions build upon or in some cases replace existing restrictions. Our updated position is set out in detail in our Climate Change Statement - our approach to sensitive sectors, and available to read in the Appendix."
"Unconventional Oil & Gas"
"In 2020, we introduced tightened restrictions with a commitment not to directly finance oil and gas projects in the Arctic Circle nor to provide finance to companies we consider to be primarily engaged in these activities."
"We will also not provide financing to ancillary Arctic oil and gas businesses where proceeds are known to be for supporting new oil and gas exploration, production, or new pipeline transportation projects in the Arctic Circle. We continue to enforce this policy."
"In 2020, we strengthened our approach to the financing of oil sands. We will only provide financing to clients who have projects to reduce materially their overall emissions intensity, and a plan for the company as a whole to have lower emissions intensity than the level of the median global oil producer by the end of the decade. We continue to enforce this policy and have declined to"
"Appendix"
">"
"extend or renew financing to clients that are unable to commit to such plans or projects. In 2021, we reduced our lending exposure to clients in scope of our oil sands policy by approximately c.23% year-on-year."
"Barclays does not directly finance projects involving fracking in the UK and Europe, nor do we provide any financing to companies primarily engaged in fracking activities in the UK and Europe. Any financing of fracking outside of these regions is subject to enhanced due diligence, requiring clients and transactions to demonstrate consideration of environmental and social impacts and risks. We continue to enforce this policy."

"Our approach to new investment in the Oil & Gas sector"
"We recognise that the transition to a low-carbon economy will require significant decline in oil and gas production. The IEA estimates that fossil fuels will need to decrease from 79% today to an estimated 22% of the world's energy supply by 2050 and, in its 'Net Zero Emissions by 2050: a Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector' report, it envisages no further new investment in fossil fuel supply projects. This is based on an assumption of significant deployment of clean and efficient energy technologies, including annual additions of solar PV and wind until 2030 that are four times higher than 2020 levels, as well as global energy efficiency improvements averaging 4% a year to 2030, which is around three times the average for the last 20 years. If these levels of investment are not achieved on a timely basis and/or geopolitical issues present additional challenges to near-term energy security, then governments may determine that new sources of oil and gas will continue to be required."
"We also recognise that many of the companies engaged in new oil and gas projects are large, multinationals that are critical for the transition and actively engaged in it, committing significant resources and expertise to renewables, power infrastructure, EV networks and other essential elements of decarbonisation. Whilst these"
"20"
"companies are not yet on a 1.5\u2103-aligned pathway, they are developing strategies to ensure their continued relevance in and contribution to a low-carbon economy. Typically, these companies finance their exploration activities from cash flows rather than from project finance, so apart from exiting these client relationships completely, it would be impracticable for Barclays to try to impose restrictions on financing specific activities. To ensure a just and orderly transition our priority is to continue to engage with these clients rather than simply exit them."
"We believe the financial services sector should take a considered approach to the IEA's assessment of future oil and gas requirements, taking a number of factors into account. These factors should include energy security; affordability; the ongoing need for substantial capital expenditure to provide the oil and gas still envisaged as being required in the IEA NZE scenario; the technical challenges of defining and monitoring reserves and production; and the ability of major energy companies to finance their activities from diverse sources of capital, including their balance sheets."
"Barclays will be participating in a number of industry working groups alongside peers over the coming months, some of which will look at credible and consistent"
"approaches to transition pathways in sectors where targets are being prioritised by financial institutions, including oil and gas. This includes sector working groups of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), as well as the Sectoral Pathways group of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ)."

"Introduction"
"Our climate strategy"
"Next steps and new targets"
"Having made significant progress against our target, ahead of our initial expectations, we are reviewing our sustainable financing strategy and all green financing frameworks and targets. We expect to provide a further update later this year, including new and more granular green financing targets. We are supporting public policy efforts to develop a robust taxonomy to standardise green finance target setting in the financial services sector, against which we can align our green financing framework."

"Mandate to invest from our Sustainable Impact Capital Programme, of which we have invested \u00a354 million to date."

"Our targets and progress"
"Collaboration"
"Investing directly in sustainability- focused start-ups"
"Our Sustainable Impact Capital Programme has a mandate to invest up to \u00a3 175 million of equity capital in sustainability-focused start-ups by 2025, helping to accelerate our clients' transition towards a low-carbon economy."
"From the acceleration of innovative carbon-efficient technologies and supply chains to supporting the development of viable markets for carbon capture and sequestration, the Programme is seeking out and supporting clear, scalable propositions that deliver both environmental benefits and economic returns."
"Through the Programme, we aim to fill growth stage funding gaps to help accelerate and scale catalytic and strategic solutions to environmental challenges."
"The Programme has made meaningful progress towards its five year trajectory to meet our target by building a portfolio of strategic investments which have a focus on reducing carbon footprints and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy: \u00a354 million of the \u00a3175 million overall target has been deployed since 2020, with \u00a330 million invested in 2021, up 25% from 2020."
"In 2022, the Programme will continue deploying capital to foster innovation to support Barclays' net zero ambition."

"The role of nature and biodiversity"
"Nature and biodiversity are intrinsically connected to efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change and are vital to ensuring a sustainable economy and healthy society. The financial sector will have an important role to play in stewarding responsible finance and in supporting new financial flows for a nature-positive future. As a financial services institution, Barclays has relationships with customers and clients across a wide range of sectors and geographies, who face risks to their operations, supply chains and markets from biodiversity loss and land-use change. Recognising the importance of this agenda, we are developing our understanding and evaluating the Group's environmental impacts and dependencies as well as where we can support our clients through the transition to a nature- positive economy."
"Appendix"
"< >"
"Collaboration both within and across industries is essential to this transition. During 2021, Barclays became a member of the Taskforce on Nature- related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum and joined the Get Nature Positive initiative alongside other businesses to identify opportunities to take nature-positive action. Barclays also contributed to the development of emerging methodologies to assess nature-related impacts and dependencies at a portfolio level, including the Natural Capital Finance Alliance's ENCORE biodiversity module."
"During 2022, Barclays will progress this work and, in particular, our engagement with leading initiatives, with the aim of defining a comprehensive and robust approach to nature and biodiversity over time."

"Introduction"
"Our climate strategy"
"We believe that industry cooperation, particularly in setting common standards and transparent reporting, is important for all our stakeholders. We continue to engage with peers, industry experts and academics to assess the transition to a low-carbon economy and consider emerging methodologies and taxonomies."
"Our targets and progress"
"Collaboration"
"We also seek to work closely with governments in the geographies in which we operate, supporting the development of practical and ambitious policies where appropriate. Barclays supports the introduction of a carbon price, to incentivise the reduction of emissions across the economy. We have been early and active partners with the most consequential industry initiatives on climate change, which continue to define leading practice and help set standards. We are always mindful of ensuring our engagements are appropriate and consistent with relevant regulatory requirements."
"Trade associations"
"We endeavour to advance our climate change policy through the trade associations of which we are members. Many positions taken by trade associations result from negotiation and compromise among members with different or opposing views. We will contribute to these processes, seeking to influence how they evolve. Where a trade association's position on climate change does not align with our position, we will challenge it and otherwise seek to make our view clear. Barclays reserves the right to publicly dissent from a trade association's position. Should a trade association adopt a material position that is irreconcilable with our values or strategy, we are prepared to end our membership."

"The Barclays PLC Board sets the strategic direction and risk appetite of the Group and is the ultimate decision-making body for matters of Group-wide strategic, financial, regulatory or reputational significance. The Board is also responsible for the oversight of social and environmental matters, including climate-related risks and opportunities."
"The Group's climate strategy is reflected in the incentive arrangements for the Executive Directors of Barclays PLC. The annual bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) outcomes for the Executive Directors are based on a framework of performance measures and targets, set each year by the Remuneration Committee of the Barclays PLC Board. A proportion of the Executive Directors' bonus and LTIP awards each year are driven by strategic non-financial measures, which in both cases include measures relating to climate. For the 2022 bonus and 2022-2024 LTIP awards, 10% of the overall outcome for each will be determined by performance against climate and sustainability measures, reflecting our ambition to be net zero by 2050, including our commitment to align our financing with the goals of the Paris Agreement."
"Reflecting the increasing risks associated with climate change, and to support Barclays' ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, in 2020, the Board Risk Committee made the decision that climate risk would become a Principal Risk within the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) from 2022 to run alongside our other Principal Risk types.\n:selected: :unselected:"
"During 2021, the Board received four updates from the Group Head of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility and Group Head of Sustainability, covering matters including progress on our climate strategy, policy updates, industry trends, stakeholder engagement and target-setting. The Board also received regular updates on Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility matters (together with Group Reputation Risk Reports) from the Group Head of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility. These updates covered matters such as key government and regulatory policy, regulatory engagement and ESG matters including climate. In addition to these Board briefings, the Group Head of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility regularly engaged with the Barclays Group Chief Executive, Chairman and Non-Executive Directors on a range of matters relating to the Group's climate strategy. The chart on page 26 summarises Barclays' governance structure and the different responsibilities relating to climate change."
"To support this decision, in 2021 the Barclays Group delivered a Climate Risk Integration Plan with three overarching objectives: \u00b7 Governance Framework: Develop a Principal Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement and integrate climate drivers into limit setting. \u00b7 Scenario Analysis: Refine methodologies used for the 2020 scenario analysis to support the Bank of England Biennial Exploratory Scenario on climate change, with specific focus on wholesale credit and physical risk modelling. \u00b7 Carbon Modelling: Enhance the Blue Track\u2122 model to further develop the approach for the Energy sector, expand coverage to Cement and Steel and consider the overall net zero ambition of the Barclays Group.

"The Paris Agreement is a legally-binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 parties at COP21 in Paris. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2\u2103, preferably to 1.5\u2103, compared to pre-industrial levels"
"Renewables"
"Energy taken from sources that are inexhaustible, e.g. wind, water, solar, geothermal energy, and biofuels"
"Scenario analysis"
"Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change are without historical precedent. Forward-looking analyses, such as scenario analysis, can help organisations consider a broader range of assumptions, uncertainties, and potential future states when assessing financial implications of climate change"
"Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs)"
"In the UK, Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) are currently defined as having less than 75 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km) from the tail pipe (Source: https://carfueldata.vehicle-certification-agency.gov.uk/additional/2021/2021%20 Booklet.pdf). Definitions may differ slightly in other jurisdictions but the term generally refers to vehicles that use low carbon technologies"

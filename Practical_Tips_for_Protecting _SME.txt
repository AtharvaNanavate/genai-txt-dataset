"UT HOR\nNational Cyber Security Centre a part of GCHQ\nCyber security: Practical Tips for Protecting Your Organisation Online :selected: :selected: :selected:\nOrganisational Cyber Security\nEvery organisation needs to look after its data as well as manage the risks of using online services, and so everyone needs to follow some basic principles of good cyber security as outlined in the cards.\nOrganisation owners and employees need to be aware that cyber security is a management and assurance issue. After all, poor cyber hygiene could affect an organisations ability to function, its reputation and legal obligations to keep personal data safe.\nCyber security is about protecting the devices we all use and the service we access online - both at home and work - from theft and damage.\nIt's also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices and online.\n@ Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence\nWhy Cyber Security Matters\nAn increasing number of organisations are being seriously impacted by cyber incidents: perhaps a phishing attempt to steal money and passwords, or a ransomware attack that encrypts files preventing access. But why?\n\u2022 Many cyber incidents are untargeted. They can affect any organisation that doesn't have basic levels of protection.\n\u2022 Organisations hold plenty of sensitive information. For example, organisation records, customer payment information, personal details, and passwords. All this must be kept safe and confidential.\n\u2022 Cyber criminals want to make money. They understand that an organisation's information is often sufficiently important to that organisation and that they might be prepared to pay a ransom to get it back.\nC Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence\nWho is behind cyber attacks?\nOnline criminals\nAre really good at identifying what can be monetised, for example stealing and selling sensitive data, or holding systems and information to ransom.\nHackers\nIndividuals with varying degrees of expertise, often acting in an untargeted way - perhaps to test their own skills or cause disruption for the sake of it.\nMalicious insiders\nUse their access to an organisation's data or networks to conduct malicious activity, such as stealing sensitive information to share with competitors.\nHonest Mistakes Sometimes staff, with the best intentions just make a mistake, for example by emailing something sensitive to the wrong email address.\n@ Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence :selected:\nWhat are the top threats to organisations?\nRansomware Malicious software that makes data or systems unusable until the victim makes a payment.\nPhishing Untargeted, mass emails sent to many people asking for sensitive information (such as bank details) or encouraging them to visit fake website.\n8\nVirus\nPrograms which can self-replicate and are designed to infect legitimate software programs or systems. A form of malware.\nInsider Risks The potential for damage to be done maliciously or inadvertently by a legitimate user with privileged access to systems, networks or data.\nO\nC Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence\nBe Cyber Aware\n\u2022 Create separate password for your organisation- critical accounts.\nYour accounts include sensitive information about your customers, your organisation and financial information. If your accounts are not secure, your organisation could be at risk of a cyber incident.\n\u2022 Create strong passwords using three random words. Weak passwords can be hacked in seconds. The longer and moreunusual your password is, the stronger it becomes and the harder it is to hack.\n\u00b7 Save your passwords in your browser.It is good practice to use different passwords for the accounts you care most about. Of course, remembering lots of passwords can be difficult, but if you save them in your browser then you don't have to.\nCyber Aware\ncyberaware.gov.uk\nCyber Aware is the government's advice on how to stay secure online.\nc Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence :unselected: :unselected: :unselected:\n\u2022\nTurn on 2-step verification (2SV) for your email 2-step verification (2SV) gives you twice the protection so even if cyber criminals have your password, they can't access your email. 2SV works by asking for more information to prove your identity. For example, getting a code sent to your phone when you sign in using a new device or change settings such as your password. You won't be asked for this every time you check your email.\n\u00b7 Keep your organisation device up to date Make sure all your devices have the latest software updates to reduce the risk of a cyber incidents. This will ensure that all your devices include the latest security.\n\u2022\nBack up important organisation data and key contacts\nBy backing up your data, your organisation can continue operating even if you suffer a cyber incident. Backups can include paper copies, removable media or backed up to the cloud.\nhttps://cyberaware.gov.uk/\nC Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence :unselected:\nPreparing for a cyber incident\nWhile implementing good security controls is important, there is no such thing as perfect security.\nAll organisations are at risk of a potential cyber incident, so it is vital you prepare your response and plan your recovery in the event of a cyber incident.\n!\nC Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence\nWhat can you do to prepare for an incident?\n\u2022 Identify critical electronic information Such as contact details, emails calendars, and essential documents. Also identify the key systems and resources to keep your organisation running.\n\u2022 Make a regular back up of essential information Regularly test that the backup is working to ensure you can restore information from it.\n\u2022 Make a list of the key partners that you use to run your organisation This will aid your response in the event of an incident and will enable you to keep your organisation active offline or in the event of unavailable systems. e.g. supplier contact numbers, IT support number.\n\u2022 Make an incident plan and keep it safe so you can use it if your equipment is stolen or damaged by a cyber incident.\nSee our full guide for more information on how to prepare and plan. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/small-business-guidance -- response-and- recovery\n@ Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence\nReporting an incident\nWhat is an incident? A cyber incident is an unauthorised access (or attempted access) to an organisation's IT systems. These may be malicious attacks (such ransomware or phishing attacks), or could be accidental incidents (such as damage from fire/flood/ theft). :unselected: :selected: :unselected: -\nReporting If your organisation suffers a cyber incident or is affected by fraud (e.g. money lost a result of a phishing email or your IT systems are compromised), report it to Action Fraud by calling 0300 123 2040 or go to www.actionfraud.police.uk or in Scotland through Police Scotland's 101 call centre.\nIf you have received an email which you're not quite sure about, forward it to the Suspicious Email Reporting Service (SERS): report@phishing.gov.uk\nC Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence :selected:\nMoving your organisation from the physical to the digital.\nIf you are moving or currently running your organisation online this will present new risks, by placing more reliance on digital technologies such as web hosting, credit card processing, and productivity tools like email, video and chat. Having good relationship with your IT service provider(s) will help massively with this.\nIf you are talking directly with your supplier or you are in charge of your own IT, the following points will help you ensure that security is at the forefront of any new service you decide to use.\n\u2022 Patching & Updates Ask your providers how often they patch the services you use, and check any contracts or SLAs to ensure that patching is included.\n\u2022 Backups What sort of backup arrangements are in place and how often are these tested? You should know how often your data is backed up, where it is stored, and who has access to it.\nC Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence\n\u2022 Access: Is your data (and the data of others which you have responsibility for) being properly protected? Are you able to put 2FA in place to limit access to your data and services?\n\u2022 Logs Are logs being kept for security purposes? Logging can play a vital role in diagnosing any problems. Logs will also prove invaluable when responding to and recovering from security incidents.\n\u2022 Response will happen if things go wrong? Service providers should operate on the presumption that they will be attacked. It should be clear how and when they will engage with you during a security incident.\nWhat\nFind out more:\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/moving-business-from-physical-to-digital\nC Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence :unselected:\nYou will find all this advice and guidance and more on our website:\n\u2022 Small Business Guide How to improve your cyber security; affordable, actionable advice for organisations. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/smallbusiness\n\u2022 Small Charities Guide How to improve cyber security within your charity - quickly, easily and at low cost. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/charity\n\u2022 Response & Recovery Guide Guidance that helps small to medium sized organisations prepare their response to and plan their recovery from a cyber incident. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/small-business-guidance -- response-and-recovery\n\u2022 Top Tips for Staff The NCSC's e-learning package 'Top Tips for Staff' can be completed online, or built into your own training platform.

"Organisational Cyber Security"
"Every organisation needs to look after its data as well as manage the risks of using online services, and so everyone needs to follow some basic principles of good cyber security as outlined in the cards."
"Organisation owners and employees need to be aware that cyber security is a management and assurance issue. After all, poor cyber hygiene could affect an organisations ability to function, its reputation and legal obligations to keep personal data safe."
"Cyber security is about protecting the devices we all use and the service we access online - both at home and work - from theft and damage."
"It's also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices and online."

"Why Cyber Security Matters"
"An increasing number of organisations are being seriously impacted by cyber incidents: perhaps a phishing attempt to steal money and passwords, or a ransomware attack that encrypts files preventing access. But why?"
"\u2022 Many cyber incidents are untargeted. They can affect any organisation that doesn't have basic levels of protection."
"\u2022 Organisations hold plenty of sensitive information. For example, organisation records, customer payment information, personal details, and passwords. All this must be kept safe and confidential."
"\u2022 Cyber criminals want to make money. They understand that an organisation's information is often sufficiently important to that organisation and that they might be prepared to pay a ransom to get it back."
"C Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence"
"Who is behind cyber attacks?"
"Online criminals"
"Are really good at identifying what can be monetised, for example stealing and selling sensitive data, or holding systems and information to ransom."
"Hackers"
"Individuals with varying degrees of expertise, often acting in an untargeted way - perhaps to test their own skills or cause disruption for the sake of it."
"Malicious insiders"
"Use their access to an organisation's data or networks to conduct malicious activity, such as stealing sensitive information to share with competitors."
"Honest Mistakes Sometimes staff, with the best intentions just make a mistake, for example by emailing something sensitive to the wrong email address."
"@ Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence"
"What are the top threats to organisations?"
"Ransomware Malicious software that makes data or systems unusable until the victim makes a payment."
"Phishing Untargeted, mass emails sent to many people asking for sensitive information (such as bank details) or encouraging them to visit fake website."
"8"
"Virus"
"Programs which can self-replicate and are designed to infect legitimate software programs or systems. A form of malware."

"Be Cyber Aware"
"\u2022 Create separate password for your organisation- critical accounts."
"Your accounts include sensitive information about your customers, your organisation and financial information. If your accounts are not secure, your organisation could be at risk of a cyber incident."
"\u2022 Create strong passwords using three random words. Weak passwords can be hacked in seconds. The longer and moreunusual your password is, the stronger it becomes and the harder it is to hack."
"\u00b7 Save your passwords in your browser.It is good practice to use different passwords for the accounts you care most about. Of course, remembering lots of passwords can be difficult, but if you save them in your browser then you don't have to."

"Preparing for a cyber incident"
"While implementing good security controls is important, there is no such thing as perfect security."
"All organisations are at risk of a potential cyber incident, so it is vital you prepare your response and plan your recovery in the event of a cyber incident."
"!"
"C Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence"
"What can you do to prepare for an incident?"
"\u2022 Identify critical electronic information Such as contact details, emails calendars, and essential documents. Also identify the key systems and resources to keep your organisation running."
"\u2022 Make a regular back up of essential information Regularly test that the backup is working to ensure you can restore information from it."
"\u2022 Make a list of the key partners that you use to run your organisation This will aid your response in the event of an incident and will enable you to keep your organisation active offline or in the event of unavailable systems. e.g. supplier contact numbers, IT support number."
"\u2022 Make an incident plan and keep it safe so you can use it if your equipment is stolen or damaged by a cyber incident."

"Reporting an incident"
"What is an incident? A cyber incident is an unauthorised access (or attempted access) to an organisation's IT systems. These may be malicious attacks (such ransomware or phishing attacks), or could be accidental incidents (such as damage from fire/flood/ theft)."
":unselected:"
":selected:"
":unselected: -"
"Reporting If your organisation suffers a cyber incident or is affected by fraud (e.g. money lost a result of a phishing email or your IT systems are compromised), report it to Action Fraud by calling 0300 123 2040 or go to www.actionfraud.police.uk or in Scotland through Police Scotland's 101 call centre."
"If you have received an email which you're not quite sure about, forward it to the Suspicious Email Reporting Service (SERS): report@phishing.gov.uk"
"C Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence"
"Moving your organisation from the physical to the digital."
"If you are moving or currently running your organisation online this will present new risks, by placing more reliance on digital technologies such as web hosting, credit card processing, and productivity tools like email, video and chat. Having good relationship with your IT service provider(s) will help massively with this."
"If you are talking directly with your supplier or you are in charge of your own IT, the following points will help you ensure that security is at the forefront of any new service you decide to use."
"\u2022 Patching & Updates Ask your providers how often they patch the services you use, and check any contracts or SLAs to ensure that patching is included."
"\u2022 Backups What sort of backup arrangements are in place and how often are these tested? You should know how often your data is backed up, where it is stored, and who has access to it."
"C Crown copyright 2022 NCSC information licensed for re-use under Open Government Licence"
"\u2022 Access: Is your data (and the data of others which you have responsibility for) being properly protected? Are you able to put 2FA in place to limit access to your data and services?"
"\u2022 Logs Are logs being kept for security purposes? Logging can play a vital role in diagnosing any problems. Logs will also prove invaluable when responding to and recovering from security incidents."
"\u2022 Response will happen if things go wrong? Service providers should operate on the presumption that they will be attacked. It should be clear how and when they will engage with you during a security incident."

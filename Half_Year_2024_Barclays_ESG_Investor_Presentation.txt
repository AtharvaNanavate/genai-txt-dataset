We also joined the joint RMI and UK Finance Transition Finance Alignment Forum\nCentre for Climate Energy Solutions (C2ES)\nC2ES CENTER FOR CLIMATE AND ENERGY SOLUTIONS\nBarclays joined the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) Business Environmental Leadership Council (BELC) in 2022. In 2023 we collaborated with C2ES on a range of issues, including participating in their technology working group and co-hosting an event at COP28 on supporting the global climate technology momentum\nUK Business Climate Hub\nUK BUSINESS CLIMATE HUB\nIn the final quarter of 2023, Barclays partnered with the UK Business Climate Hub - an online portal supporting SMEs on their journey to net zero. Barclays is helping shape and enhance the resources the Hub provides to UK business, ensuring our SME clients' voices are heard and their needs met. This new partnership will help each SME client understand why sustainability is important for their business and what 'good' looks like in the context of their industry :selected:\nBarclays H1 2024 ESG Investor Presentation August 2024\n50\nBarclays has adopted a holistic approach to Financial Crime\nCombined approach allows us to identify and manage relevant synergies and connections between the four key risk areas\n1\nAnti-bribery and corruption (ABC)\nGroup-wide Financial Crime Policy Sets minimum control requirements in four key risk areas\nAnti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML)\n2\nAnti-tax evasion facilitation (ATEF)\nSanctions 4\n3\nSupported by:\nTwelve group-wide Financial Crime Standards and associated risk-based systems and controls\nDedicated global Financial Crime function providing expert support and oversight to the business and our legal entities\nBarclays H1 2024 ESG Investor Presentation August 2024\n51\nWe continue to foster a culture where our colleagues feel safe to speak up\nColleagues are encouraged to speak up about actions and behaviours that have no place in the organisation.

This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and sustainability metrics, measurement of climate risk and scenario analysis\n\u00b7 Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and methodologies made available by third parties (over which we have no control) and which may have been prepared using a range of different methodologies, or where the basis of preparation may not be known to us. Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies are subject to future risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Climate and sustainability disclosures in this document, including climate and sustainability-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information and use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate and sustainability disclosures are also not subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data cannot be relied on as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis\n\u2022 Continued (and will continue) to review and develop our approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with market principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and methodologies used (including those made available by third parties) and the judgements, estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report. Further, changes in external factors which are outside of our control such as accounting and/or reporting standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/or updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact - potentially materially - the performance metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report. In future reports we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties) using updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies, market practices or standards. Equally, we may need to re-baseline, restate, revise, recalculate or recalibrate performance against targets, convergence points or milestones on the basis of such updated data. Such updated information may result in different outcomes than those included in the Annual Report. It is important for readers and users of the Annual Report to be aware that direct, like-for-like comparisons of each piece of information disclosed may not always be possible from one reporting period to another. The \"Implementing our climate strategy\" section of the Annual Report highlights where information in respect of a previous reporting period has been updated. Our principles-based approach to reporting financed emissions data (see page 84 of the Annual Report) sets out when financed emissions information in respect of a prior year will be identified and explained\n\u2022 Included in the Annual Report a number of graphics, infographics, text boxes and illustrative case studies and credentials which aim to give a high-level overview of certain elements of the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report and improve accessibility for readers. These graphics, infographics, text boxes and illustrative case studies and credentials are designed to be read within the context of the Annual Report as a whole.\nKPMG LLP has performed limited independent assurance over selected climate and sustainability content, which has been marked with the symbol 4. The assurance engagement was planned and performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance of Greenhouse Gas Statements. A limited assurance opinion was issued and is available at the website link below. This includes details of the scope, reporting criteria, respective responsibilities, work performed, limitations and conclusion. No other information in the Annual Report has been subject to this external limited assurance.\nThere are a variety of internal and external factors which may impact our reported metrics and progress against our targets, convergence points and milestones.\nInformation provided in climate and sustainability disclosures\nWhat is important to our investors and stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to anticipate and respond to these changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and sustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and sustainability disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance, and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but may also be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group, including during management presentations, in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions - including policy on dividends and share buybacks - return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets - including ESG commitments and targets - plans and objectives for future operations, and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation; regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices, and the interpretation thereof; changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital markets; market-related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on European and global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security breaches, technology failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control.\nAs a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. In setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macro-economic environment, including, without limitation, inflation, interest and unemployment rates, the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors that may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of the Annual Report.\nSubject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction - including, without limitation, the UK and the US - in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."

"Disclaimers"
"In preparing the climate and sustainability content within the Barclays PLC Annual Report wherever it appears (and to the extent it is repeated in this presentation), we have:"
"\u00b7 Made certain key judgements, estimations and assumptions. This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and sustainability metrics, measurement of climate risk and scenario analysis"
"\u00b7 Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and methodologies made available by third parties (over which we have no control) and which may"
"have been prepared using a range of different methodologies, or where the basis of preparation may not be known to us. Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and"
"methodologies are subject to future risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Climate and sustainability disclosures in this document, including climate and sustainability-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information and"
"use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate and sustainability disclosures are also not subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or"
"globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data cannot be relied on as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be"
"hard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis"
"\u2022"
"Continued (and will continue) to review and develop our approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with market principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and methodologies used (including those made available by third parties) and the judgements,"
"estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report. Further, changes in external factors which are outside of"
"our control such as accounting and/or reporting standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/or updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact - potentially materially - the performance metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and"
"milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report. In future reports we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties) using updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies,"
"market practices or standards. Equally, we may need to re-baseline, restate, revise, recalculate or recalibrate performance against targets, convergence points or milestones on the basis of such updated data. Such updated information may result in different outcomes than those included in the Annual Report. It is"
"important for readers and users of the Annual Report to be aware that direct, like-for-like comparisons of each piece of information disclosed may not always be possible from one reporting period to another. The \"Implementing our climate strategy\" section of the Annual Report highlights where information in respect"
"of a previous reporting period has been updated. Our principles-based approach to reporting financed emissions data (see page 84 of the Annual Report) sets out when financed emissions information in respect of a prior year will be identified and explained"
"\u2022"
"Included in the Annual Report a number of graphics, infographics, text boxes and illustrative case studies and credentials which aim to give a high-level overview of certain elements of the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report and improve accessibility for readers. These graphics, infographics, text"
"boxes and illustrative case studies and credentials are designed to be read within the context of the Annual Report as a whole."
"KPMG LLP has performed limited independent assurance over selected climate and sustainability content, which has been marked with the symbol 4. The assurance engagement was planned and performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements"
"Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance of Greenhouse Gas Statements. A limited assurance opinion was issued and is available at the website link below. This includes details of the scope, reporting criteria, respective"
"responsibilities, work performed, limitations and conclusion. No other information in the Annual Report has been subject to this external limited assurance."
"There are a variety of internal and external factors which may impact our reported metrics and progress against our targets, convergence points and milestones."
"Information provided in climate and sustainability disclosures"
"What is important to our investors and stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to anticipate and respond to these changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of"
"detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and sustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which"
"may include evolving stakeholder views, the development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and sustainability disclosures are subject to more"
"uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in"
"regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards."
"Forward-looking Statements"
"This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of"
"future performance, and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements"
"sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but may also be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group,"
"including during management presentations, in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges,"
"provisions, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions - including policy on dividends and share buybacks - return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets - including ESG commitments and targets - plans and"

This requires net zero targets (NZE 1.5\u2103-aligned or equivalent) across all relevant scopes, including Use of Sold Product (Scope 3, Category 11) by 2050 (for Energy), evidence of strong progress already made, and disclosures of advanced planning to reduce emissions further"
"T2"
"Clients have targets across all relevant scopes and strong plans but may be missing some of the clarifying details of a T1 plan - or may not have demonstrated strong steps taken to date"
"T3"
"Clients may have very ambitious targets but lack the details to evidence that they will achieve it, a weak target but robust disclosures evidencing that they will achieve it, or a combination thereof. Energy clients without Scope 3 disclosures and Scope 3 targets cannot achieve better than T3"
"T4"
"Clients have poorly disclosed plans. They generally have some combination of targets that are weaker than the scenarios require, disclosures lacking in detail, or limited evidence that steps are already being taken"
"T5 (worst)"
"Clients have the default and lowest score. These clients provide limited publicly available information on their sustainability targets and strategy. A client must have publicly demonstrated transition planning including some evidence of their historic, current and future emissions reduction efforts to score better than T5"

"\u2022 Both stress tests reflected a c. 10% drag on the Bank's profitability, in line with 2021 BoE CBES exercise. Additionally, the exercises represent a c. 10-20% uplift in losses incurred in the existing macroeconomic internal stress test"

"1 A series of risk events lead to a drastic shift in public sentiment, demanding a policy response. Faced with a severe economic recession, impactful policies are announced to take effect during economic recovery. However, it leads to an immediate repricing of assets"
"2 Existing government climate policies come into affect and contribute to the recovery, as these policies are largely investment and funding which will spur on economic activity"
"3 More stringent government climate policies - the expansion of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the rapid introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) - come into effect. This induces a carbon price shock and leads to a dampened recovery"

"Clients are fully aligned with our NZE targets. This requires net zero targets (NZE 1.5\u2103-aligned or equivalent) across all relevant scopes, including Use of Sold Product (Scope 3, Category 11) by 2050 (for Energy), evidence of strong progress already made, and disclosures of advanced planning to reduce emissions further"
"T2"
"Clients have targets across all relevant scopes and strong plans but may be missing some of the clarifying details of a T1 plan - or may not have demonstrated strong steps taken to date"
"T3"
"Clients may have very ambitious targets but lack the details to evidence that they will achieve it, a weak target but robust disclosures evidencing that they will achieve it, or a combination thereof. Energy clients without Scope 3 disclosures and Scope 3 targets cannot achieve better than T3"
"T4"
"Clients have poorly disclosed plans. They generally have some combination of targets that are weaker than the scenarios require, disclosures lacking in detail, or limited evidence that steps are already being taken"
"T5 (worst)"
"Clients have the default and lowest score. These clients provide limited publicly available information on their sustainability targets and strategy. A client must have publicly demonstrated transition planning including some evidence of their historic, current and future emissions reduction efforts to score better than T5"

"In preparing the climate and sustainability content within the Barclays PLC Annual Report wherever it appears (and to the extent it is repeated in this presentation), we have:"
"\u00b7 Made certain key judgements, estimations and assumptions. This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and sustainability metrics, measurement of climate risk and scenario analysis"
"\u00b7 Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and methodologies made available by third parties (over which we have no control) and which may have been prepared using a range of different methodologies, or where the basis of preparation may not be known to us. Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies are subject to future risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Climate and sustainability disclosures in this document, including climate and sustainability-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information and use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate and sustainability disclosures are also not subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data cannot be relied on as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis"
"\u2022 Continued (and will continue) to review and develop our approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with market principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and methodologies used (including those made available by third parties) and the judgements, estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report. Further, changes in external factors which are outside of our control such as accounting and/or reporting standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/or updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact - potentially materially - the performance metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report. In future reports we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties) using updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies, market practices or standards. Equally, we may need to re-baseline, restate, revise, recalculate or recalibrate performance against targets, convergence points or milestones on the basis of such updated data. Such updated information may result in different outcomes than those included in the Annual Report. It is important for readers and users of the Annual Report to be aware that direct, like-for-like comparisons of each piece of information disclosed may not always be possible from one reporting period to another. The \"Implementing our climate strategy\" section of the Annual Report highlights where information in respect of a previous reporting period has been updated. Our principles-based approach to reporting financed emissions data (see page 84 of the Annual Report) sets out when financed emissions information in respect of a prior year will be identified and explained"
"\u2022 Included in the Annual Report a number of graphics, infographics, text boxes and illustrative case studies and credentials which aim to give a high-level overview of certain elements of the climate and sustainability content within the Annual Report and improve accessibility for readers. These graphics, infographics, text boxes and illustrative case studies and credentials are designed to be read within the context of the Annual Report as a whole."
"KPMG LLP has performed limited independent assurance over selected climate and sustainability content, which has been marked with the symbol 4. The assurance engagement was planned and performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance of Greenhouse Gas Statements. A limited assurance opinion was issued and is available at the website link below. This includes details of the scope, reporting criteria, respective responsibilities, work performed, limitations and conclusion. No other information in the Annual Report has been subject to this external limited assurance."
"There are a variety of internal and external factors which may impact our reported metrics and progress against our targets, convergence points and milestones."
"Information provided in climate and sustainability disclosures"
"What is important to our investors and stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to anticipate and respond to these changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and sustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and sustainability disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards."
"Forward-looking Statements"
"This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance, and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but may also be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group, including during management presentations, in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions - including policy on dividends and share buybacks - return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets - including ESG commitments and targets - plans and objectives for future operations, and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation; regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices, and the interpretation thereof; changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital markets; market-related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on European and global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security breaches, technology failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control."
"As a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. In setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macro-economic environment, including, without limitation, inflation, interest and unemployment rates, the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors that may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of the Annual Report."
"Subject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction - including, without limitation, the UK and the US - in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."

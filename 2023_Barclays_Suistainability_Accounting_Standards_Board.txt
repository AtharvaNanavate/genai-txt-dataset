"Barclays PLC Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\nBARCLAYS\nCommercial banks\nConsumer finance\nGroup metrics\nMortgage finance\nInvestment banking and brokerage\n01\nBarclays PLC Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\nBarclays started reporting against the SASB standards in 2019 as we recognise the importance among our investor base.\nSASB is a global framework with, at present, a US-focused approach to defining criteria, and so we have aimed to include cross- references to the most relevant parts of our UK-based reporting to the SASB indicators, having regard to the purpose behind the SASB indicators.\nAs of August 2022, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation assumed responsibility for the SASB Standards. The ISSB has committed to maintain, enhance and evolve the SASB Standards.\nThe table below maps where in our public documents relevant information for SASB standards and indicators can be found. The standards have been selected based on their relevance to the Barclays Group's business.\nThis report reflects the information and data available for the Barclays Group for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nCommercial banks\nConsumer finance\nInvestment banking and brokerage\nGroup metrics\nMortgage finance\nGroup metrics\nThe following disclosures are taken from individual Standards and disclosed at a Group level to reflect the business-wide approach.\n02\nBarclays PLC Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\nTopic\nAccounting metric\nCode\nSummary of bank's response\nTransparent Information & Fair Advice for Customers\nDescription of approach to\nFN-AC-270a.3\n\u00b7 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023:\ninforming customers about products and services\nThe Barclays Way on page 245\nCompliance risk on pages 281-282\nNote on methodology\nThis indicator was taken from the SASB Standard for Asset Management & Custody Activities.\nEmployee Diversity and Inclusion\nPercentage of (1) gender and (2) FN-AC-330a.1\n\u00b7 ESG Data Centre\ndiversity group representation for:\n\u00b7 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023:\n(1) executive management,\nColleagues on pages 27-29 Board Nominations Committee report on pages 156-165\n(2) non-executive management,\n\u00b7 Board Diversity Policy\n(3) professionals, and\n\u00b7 Barclays PLC Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report 2022\n(4) all other employees\n\u00b7 Barclays PLC Fair Pay Report 2023\nNote on methodology\nThis indicator was taken from the SASB Standard for Asset Management & Custody Activities.\nIncorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Investment Management & Advisory\nDescription of approach to incorporation of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investment or wealth management processes and strategies\nFN-AC-410a.2\n\u00b7 Barclays Private Bank Responsible Investing Policy \u00b7 The science and art of manager selection white paper\nNote on methodology This indicator was taken from the SASB Standard for Asset Management & Custody Activities.\nDescription of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures\nFN-AC-410a.3\n\u00b7 Barclays Private Bank Responsible Investing Policy \u00b7 Barclays Wealth Management Stewardship Code\nNote on methodology\nThis indicator was taken from the SASB Standard for Asset Management & Custody Activities. :unselected: :selected:\nGroup metrics\nCommercial banks Consumer finance\nGroup metrics (continued)\nMortgage finance\nInvestment banking and brokerage\nBarclays PLC Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\nTopic\nAccounting metric\nCode\nSummary of bank's response\nBusiness Ethics\nTotal amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with fraud, insider trading, anti-trust, anti- competitive behaviour, market manipulation, malpractice, or other related financial industry laws or regulations\nFN-AC-510a.1\nFor information in relation to legal and competition and regulatory matters, please refer to Note 25 Legal, competition and regulatory matters, Note 23 Provisions and Note 24 Contingent Liabilities and commitments in the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023.

Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\nDisclaimer\nInformation provided in climate and sustainability disclosures\nWhat is important to our investors and stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to anticipate and respond to these changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and sustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and sustainability disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards.\nThese factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate and sustainability disclosures. We give no assurance as to the likelihood of the achievement or reasonableness of any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns contained in our climate and sustainability disclosures and make no commitment to revise or update any such disclosures to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of such statements.\nDisclaimers\nIn preparing the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure wherever it appears, we have:\n1. Made certain key judgements, estimations and assumptions. This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and sustainability metrics, measurement of climate risk and scenario analysis\n2. Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and methodologies made available by third parties (over which we have no control) and which may have been prepared using a range of different methodologies, or where the basis of preparation may not be known to us. Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies are subject to future risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Climate and sustainability disclosures in this document, including climate and sustainability-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information and use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate and sustainability disclosures are also not subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data cannot be relied on as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis\n3. Continued (and will continue) to review and develop our approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with market principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and methodologies used (including those made available by third parties) and the judgements, estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure. Further, changes in external factors which are outside of our control such as accounting and/or reporting standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/or updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact - potentially materially - the performance metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in this disclosure. In future disclosures we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties) using updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies, market practices or standards. Equally, we may need to re-baseline, restate, revise, recalculate or recalibrate performance against targets, convergence points or milestones on the basis of such updated data. Such updated information may result in different outcomes than those included in this disclosure. It is important for readers and users of this disclosure to be aware that direct, like-for-like comparisons of each piece of information disclosed may not always be possible from one reporting period to another. The \"Implementing our climate strategy\" section of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 highlights where information in respect of a previous reporting period has been updated. Our principles-based approach to reporting financed emissions data (see page 84 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023) sets out when financed emissions information in respect of a prior year will be identified and explained.\nKPMG LLP has performed limited independent assurance over selected climate and sustainability content, which has been marked with the symbol 4. The assurance engagement was planned and performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance of Greenhouse Gas Statements. A limited assurance opinion was issued and is available at the website link below. This includes details of the scope, reporting criteria, respective responsibilities, work performed, limitations and conclusion. No other information in this disclosure has been subject to this external limited assurance.\nThere are a variety of internal and external factors which may impact our reported metrics and progress against our targets, convergence points and milestones.\nGroup metrics\nCommercial banks\nConsumer finance\nForward-looking statements\nMortgage finance\nInvestment banking and brokerage\n11\nBarclays PLC Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance, and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but may also be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group, including during management presentations, in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions - including policy on dividends and share buybacks - return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets - including ESG commitments and targets - plans and objectives for future operations, and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation; regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices, and the interpretation thereof; changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital markets; market-related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on European and global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security breaches, technology failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control. As a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non- financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. Without limitation, in setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macroeconomic environment, including inflation, interest and unemployment rates, the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors that may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023.\nSubject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction - including, without limitation, the UK and the US - in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nBARCLAYS\nBarclays PLC 2024 Registered office: 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP Registered in England.

"Disclaimer"
"Information provided in climate and sustainability disclosures"
"What is important to our investors and stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to anticipate and respond to these changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast"
"moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We"
"have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and sustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the"
"development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and"
"sustainability disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of estimates, judgements and"
"assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards."
"These factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events"
"or conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate and sustainability disclosures. We give no assurance as to the likelihood"
"of the achievement or reasonableness of any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns contained in our climate and sustainability disclosures and make no commitment to revise or"
"update any such disclosures to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of such statements."
"Disclaimers"
"In preparing the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure wherever it appears, we have:"
"1. Made certain key judgements, estimations and assumptions. This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and"
"sustainability metrics, measurement of climate risk and scenario analysis"
"2. Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and"
"methodologies made available by third parties (over which we have no control) and which may have been prepared using a range of different methodologies, or where the basis of preparation may not be known to us."
"Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies are subject to future risks"
"and uncertainties and may change over time. Climate and sustainability disclosures in this document, including climate and sustainability-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in"
"the context of other financial information and use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate and"
"sustainability disclosures are also not subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data cannot be relied on as a strong"
"indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be"
"hard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis"
"3. Continued (and will continue) to review and develop our approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with market principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and"
"methodologies used (including those made available by third parties) and the judgements, estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data points,"
"targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure. Further, changes in external factors which are outside of our control such as accounting and/or reporting"
"standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/or updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact - potentially materially - the performance metrics, data"
"points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in this disclosure. In future disclosures we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties)"
"using updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies, market practices or standards. Equally, we may need to re-baseline, restate, revise, recalculate or recalibrate performance against targets,"
"convergence points or milestones on the basis of such updated data. Such updated information may result in different outcomes than those included in this disclosure. It is important for readers and users of this disclosure to be"
"aware that direct, like-for-like comparisons of each piece of information disclosed may not always be possible from one reporting period to another. The \"Implementing our climate strategy\" section of the Barclays PLC Annual"
"Report 2023 highlights where information in respect of a previous reporting period has been updated. Our principles-based approach to reporting financed emissions data (see page 84 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023) sets"
"out when financed emissions information in respect of a prior year will be identified and explained."
"KPMG LLP has performed limited independent assurance over selected climate and sustainability content, which has been marked with the symbol 4. The assurance engagement was planned and performed in accordance with the"
"International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance of"
"Greenhouse Gas Statements. A limited assurance opinion was issued and is available at the website link below. This includes details of the scope, reporting criteria, respective responsibilities, work performed, limitations and"
"conclusion. No other information in this disclosure has been subject to this external limited assurance."
"There are a variety of internal and external factors which may impact our reported metrics and progress against our targets, convergence points and milestones."

"Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of"
"similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but may also be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group, including during management presentations,"
"in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy,"
"income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions - including policy on dividends and share buybacks - return on"
"tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets - including ESG commitments and targets - plans and objectives for future"
"operations, and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances."
"Forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation;"
"regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices, and the interpretation thereof; changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other"
"accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal"
"proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental,"
"social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and"
"other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital"
"markets; market-related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit ratings of any"
"entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on"
"European and global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks,"
"information or security breaches, technology failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and"
"the success of acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control. As a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non-"
"financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. Without"
"limitation, in setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macroeconomic environment, including inflation, interest and unemployment rates,"
"the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors that"
"may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023."
"Subject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction - including, without limitation, the UK and the US - in relation to disclosure and ongoing information,"
"we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."

"SASB is a global framework with, at present, a US-focused approach to defining criteria, and so we have aimed to include cross- references to the most relevant parts of our UK-based reporting to the SASB indicators, having regard to the purpose behind the SASB indicators."
"As of August 2022, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation assumed responsibility for the SASB Standards. The ISSB has committed to maintain, enhance and evolve the SASB Standards."
"The table below maps where in our public documents relevant information for SASB standards and indicators can be found. The standards have been selected based on their relevance to the Barclays Group's business."

"Disclaimer"
"Information provided in climate and sustainability disclosures"
"What is important to our investors and stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to anticipate and respond to these changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and sustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and sustainability disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards."
"These factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate and sustainability disclosures. We give no assurance as to the likelihood of the achievement or reasonableness of any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns contained in our climate and sustainability disclosures and make no commitment to revise or update any such disclosures to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of such statements."
"Disclaimers"
"In preparing the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure wherever it appears, we have:"
"1. Made certain key judgements, estimations and assumptions. This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and sustainability metrics, measurement of climate risk and scenario analysis"
"2. Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and methodologies made available by third parties (over which we have no control) and which may have been prepared using a range of different methodologies, or where the basis of preparation may not be known to us. Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies are subject to future risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Climate and sustainability disclosures in this document, including climate and sustainability-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information and use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate and sustainability disclosures are also not subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data cannot be relied on as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis"
"3. Continued (and will continue) to review and develop our approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with market principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and methodologies used (including those made available by third parties) and the judgements, estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure. Further, changes in external factors which are outside of our control such as accounting and/or reporting standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/or updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact - potentially materially - the performance metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in this disclosure. In future disclosures we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties) using updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies, market practices or standards. Equally, we may need to re-baseline, restate, revise, recalculate or recalibrate performance against targets, convergence points or milestones on the basis of such updated data. Such updated information may result in different outcomes than those included in this disclosure. It is important for readers and users of this disclosure to be aware that direct, like-for-like comparisons of each piece of information disclosed may not always be possible from one reporting period to another. The \"Implementing our climate strategy\" section of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 highlights where information in respect of a previous reporting period has been updated. Our principles-based approach to reporting financed emissions data (see page 84 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023) sets out when financed emissions information in respect of a prior year will be identified and explained."
"KPMG LLP has performed limited independent assurance over selected climate and sustainability content, which has been marked with the symbol 4. The assurance engagement was planned and performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance of Greenhouse Gas Statements. A limited assurance opinion was issued and is available at the website link below. This includes details of the scope, reporting criteria, respective responsibilities, work performed, limitations and conclusion. No other information in this disclosure has been subject to this external limited assurance."
"There are a variety of internal and external factors which may impact our reported metrics and progress against our targets, convergence points and milestones."

"This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance, and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but may also be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group, including during management presentations, in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions - including policy on dividends and share buybacks - return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets - including ESG commitments and targets - plans and objectives for future operations, and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation; regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices, and the interpretation thereof; changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital markets; market-related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on European and global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security breaches, technology failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control. As a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non- financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. Without limitation, in setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macroeconomic environment, including inflation, interest and unemployment rates, the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors that may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023."
"Subject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction - including, without limitation, the UK and the US - in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."

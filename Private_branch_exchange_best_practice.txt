"11/8/24, 10:17 PM\nPrivate Branch Exchange (PBX) best practice - NCSC.GOV.UK\nPrivate Branch Exchange (PBX) best practice\nProtecting your organisation's telephony systems from cyber attacks and telecoms fraud.\nNote:\nAll PBX systems should follow the NICC's Requirements on Communications Providers in relation to Customer Line Identification display services and other related services (.pdf).\nA Private Branch Exchange (PBX) is a telecommunications system used to manage and route incoming and outgoing telephone calls within an organisation. Implementing the steps outlined in this guidance will reduce the likelihood of attackers compromising your PBX system, whether to commit fraud, instigate denial of service (Dos) attacks, or exploit telecoms channels.\nThis guidance is aimed at administrators and/or procurers of PBX systems, so some knowledge of telecommunications is assumed.\nIntroduction\nAs with any system that's connected to the internet, PBX systems, if not configured correctly, are at risk of being compromised by attackers. Attackers can find vulnerabilities by using scanners or by exploiting system weaknesses such as unchanged default passwords, open SIP ports, or incorrectly managed (or non-existent) firewalls.\nOnce inside, criminals can route high-rate international or premium-rate numbers through the system. These attacks (also known as 'dial-through fraud') are generally prolonged and involve expensive telephone numbers being dialled hundreds or even thousands of times.\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/private-branch-exchange-best-practice\n1/8\n11/8/24, 10:17 PM\nPrivate Branch Exchange (PBX) best practice - NCSC.GOV.UK\nAs the PBX owner, you are responsible for the security and administration of your phone system. Your service provider may have systems in place to help detect and notify you of hacking attempts and fraud, but as the business owner you will be expected to pay the bill.\nWhat is a PBX?\nA Private Branch Exchange (PBX) is a telecommunications system used to manage and route incoming and outgoing telephone calls within an organisation. In essence, a PBX serves as a private internal telephone network that allows employees to communicate both internally and externally.\nHistorically, PBX systems were hardware-based systems that required physical switches and cables to connect calls within an organisation. However, with advancements in technology, PBX systems have evolved into digital and software-based solutions that offer a wide range of features beyond basic call routing. As an essential component of modern business, it is important to protect and secure the PBX from potential security threats and vulnerabilities.\nTypes of PBX\nThere are several types of PBX system, each with its own characteristics and applications.\nTraditional PBX\nHardware-based systems that were commonly used before the rise of digital and IP- based technologies. They manage incoming and outgoing calls within an organisation using physical hardware components like switches and cables. A significant cost of installing these switches was the wiring needed to physically connect each user to the PBX equipment.\nIP PBX\nAlso known as VoIP PBX, IP PBX is a digital PBX system that uses internet protocol (IP) to transmit voice and data. These systems use the organisation's existing data network to transmit voice calls as packets of data, allowing for more efficient and cost- effective communication. IP PBX systems often offer advanced features like voicemail-to-email, video conferencing, and integration with other digital\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/private-branch-exchange-best-practice\n2/8 :unselected:\n11/8/24, 10:17 PM\nPrivate Branch Exchange (PBX) best practice - NCSC.GOV.UK\ncommunication tools. These systems can use wifi networks to reduce installation and maintenance costs.\nHosted/cloud PBX\nIn a hosted or cloud PBX system, the PBX hardware and software are hosted by a third-party service provider off site. Organisations connect to the cloud PBX over the internet, eliminating the need for on-premises equipment. This approach is particularly attractive to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that want advanced PBX features without the infrastructure and maintenance costs.\nVirtual PBX\nVirtual PBX is a software-based PBX solution that runs on virtualised servers. It is a subset of IP PBX systems and is often used by businesses that prefer not to invest in physical hardware. Virtual PBX can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud and offers features similar to traditional PBX systems.\nHybrid PBX\nThese systems combine elements of both traditional and IP PBX systems. They are suitable for organisations that want to migrate to IP-based communication gradually, while still using existing analogue or digital lines.\nGeneral mitigations for PBX systems\nThe NCSC recommend you implement the following security controls for all PBX systems.\nSecure access controls and user authentication\n. Ensure users understand the importance of strong passwords, and provide them with assistance if necessary.\n. Continuously monitor and audit user accounts to identify and disable any unused or unauthorised accounts.\n. Many PBX systems feature an administrative interface accessible through a specific combination of numbers and characters dialled during a call. As with administrator passwords, it's essential that you change any default values that may be in place. You should also implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/private-branch-exchange-best-practice\n3/8\nPrivate Branch Exchange (PBX) best practice - NCSC.GOV.UK\n11/8/24, 10:17 PM\nLimit calls\n. Limit dialling patterns. Restrict the types of numbers and destinations that employees can dial to prevent fraud and unauthorised use. For example you may choose to disable international calling if your company does not make calls outside the UK.\n. Disable the ability to call premium rate numbers or personal numbers; these usually have a high call cost. You may also choose to restrict out-of-hours calls (i.e. evenings, weekends, or holidays).\n. Restrict the ability to call forward or call transfer, especially to an off-premise number. PBXs can be configured to allow calls to be forwarded to a different number. The most common misuse of this is to route calls to premium rate or international numbers, but this service can also be abused so that the final called party sees the Customer Line Identifier (CLI) of the PBX rather than the scammer who is making the call.\nContracts\n\u00b7 Scrutiny of contractual terms is essential to safeguard against potential pitfalls, such as hidden charges or exorbitant fees. Thoroughly examine the contract before signing to ensure transparency and protect yourself from unintended financial consequences.\n. Ensure your contracts are clear on responsibilities and that these are covered in the contract. For example, if you have a managed service and a configuration is exploited, who is responsible for the fraud?\nMonitoring and logging\n. Use network monitoring tools to track call volumes, call patterns, and system performance. This helps in identifying unusual activity or potential security breaches.\n. Store log files securely to help with forensic analysis in case of a security incident.\nPassword management\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/private-branch-exchange-best-practice\n4/8 :unselected: :unselected: :unselected:\nPrivate Branch Exchange (PBX) best practice - NCSC.GOV.UK\n11/8/24, 10:17 PM\n\u00b7 Change default passwords for all on-premises PBX components and devices. Ensure passwords are strong, if necessary by adopting NCSC password strategies.\nFirewall and intrusion detection/prevention\n. Use firewalls to control network traffic and prevent unauthorised access to the PBX system.\n\u00b7 PBXs should have inbound/outbound traffic completely locked down to trusted IPs (that is, those of SIP trunk providers, clients and other trusted IPs). Where applicable use permit= and deny= lines in the SIP configuration file to limit IP address access, and prevent easy SIP scanning by setting alwaysauthreject=yes.\n\u00b7 Implement an intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) to detect and respond to suspicious network activities and potential security threats.\nRegular updates and patches\n. Keep the PBX system up to date with the latest security patches and updates to protect against known vulnerabilities. This includes the software and firmware running on the PBX itself and for VoIP phone components. Set up automatic updates where possible.\nEncryption\n. Implement encryption for both data in transit and data at rest within the on- premises PBX system. Use secure transport protocols (TLS) for communication between PBX components.\nRegular backups\n. Regularly schedule backups of the PBX configuration and data to ensure data integrity and facilitate disaster recovery in case of hardware failure or cyber attacks.\nRegular security audits and penetration testing\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/private-branch-exchange-best-practice\n5/8\nPrivate Branch Exchange (PBX) best practice - NCSC.GOV.UK\n11/8/24, 10:17 PM\n. Regularly conduct security audits and assess the PBX system's security posture to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.\n\u00b7 Perform penetration tests to simulate potential cyber attacks and address any identified vulnerabilities.\nDisaster recovery planning\n. Create a comprehensive plan outlining the steps to restore the PBX system in case of hardware failures, natural disasters, or cyber attacks.\n. Test and practice your response to a variety of cyber attacks using the NCSC's 'Exercise in a Box' tool.\nEmployee education and awareness\nProvide regular security training to employees to educate them about potential security threats and best practices to follow. Ensure that all relevant employees know how to recognise and respond to signs of PBX fraud such as:\n. repeated calls of short duration\n\u00b7 high numbers of incoming hung up calls\n. unexpected increases of incoming calls where the caller hangs up when answered\n. the sudden increase of freephone usage or high-cost destinations\n. long duration calls\n\u00b7 changes in after-hours calling patterns\nIn addition, companies should establish a dedicated and easily accessible reporting channel to ensure all employees have a clear and confidential way to voice their concerns.\nSpecific mitigations for cloud/hosted PBX systems\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/private-branch-exchange-best-practice\n6/8\n11/8/24, 10:17 PM\nPrivate Branch Exchange (PBX) best practice - NCSC.GOV.UK\nAs with all cloud services, you should choose and assess your provider in line with our cloud security guidance. In addition, we recommend that you specifically consider the following security controls for cloud/hosted PBX systems:\n\u00b7 Verify that the provider offers automatic updates to keep your system protected against known vulnerabilities.\n\u00b7 Confirm that your cloud/hosted PBX provider employs encryption for data in transit and data at rest within their system, and implement encryption protocols like TLS for signalling and SRTP for media streams. This ensures that voice communications are secure and protected against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\nSpecific mitigations for on-premise PBX systems\nThe NCSC recommend you implement the following security controls for on- premise PBX systems.\n. Isolate the PBX by placing it on a separate VLAN or subnet to separate it from other network components. This prevents unauthorised access from other parts of the network.\n. It is cheaper and quicker for a supplier to install a PBX 'straight out of the box', with no bespoke configuration. These can leave the bill payer with a service that can be exploited at their expense. Where possible, stipulate in the contract that the provider will bear responsibility for any losses resulting from the exploitation of a misconfiguration in the PBX.\n. Store backups in a secure, off-site location to prevent data loss due to on- premises disasters. Backups are an essential part of an organisation's response and recovery process.

"Virtual PBX is a software-based PBX solution that runs on virtualised servers. It is a"
"subset of IP PBX systems and is often used by businesses that prefer not to invest in"
"physical hardware. Virtual PBX can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud and"
"offers features similar to traditional PBX systems."
"Hybrid PBX"
"These systems combine elements of both traditional and IP PBX systems. They are"
"suitable for organisations that want to migrate to IP-based communication gradually,"
"while still using existing analogue or digital lines."
"General mitigations for PBX systems"
"The NCSC recommend you implement the following security controls for all PBX"
"systems."
"Secure access controls and user authentication"
". Ensure users understand the importance of strong passwords, and provide"
"them with assistance if necessary."
". Continuously monitor and audit user accounts to identify and disable any"
"unused or unauthorised accounts."
". Many PBX systems feature an administrative interface accessible through a"
"specific combination of numbers and characters dialled during a call. As"
"with administrator passwords, it's essential that you change any default"
"values that may be in place. You should also implement multi-factor"
"authentication (MFA) for administrative access."

"Limit calls"
". Limit dialling patterns. Restrict the types of numbers and destinations that"
"employees can dial to prevent fraud and unauthorised use. For example you"
"may choose to disable international calling if your company does not make"
"calls outside the UK."
". Disable the ability to call premium rate numbers or personal numbers; these"
"usually have a high call cost. You may also choose to restrict out-of-hours"
"calls (i.e. evenings, weekends, or holidays)."
". Restrict the ability to call forward or call transfer, especially to an off-premise"
"number. PBXs can be configured to allow calls to be forwarded to a different"
"number. The most common misuse of this is to route calls to premium rate"
"or international numbers, but this service can also be abused so that the"
"final called party sees the Customer Line Identifier (CLI) of the PBX rather"
"than the scammer who is making the call."
"Contracts"

". Ensure your contracts are clear on responsibilities and that these are"
"covered in the contract. For example, if you have a managed service and a"
"configuration is exploited, who is responsible for the fraud?"
"Monitoring and logging"
". Use network monitoring tools to track call volumes, call patterns, and system"
"performance. This helps in identifying unusual activity or potential security"
"breaches."
". Store log files securely to help with forensic analysis in case of a security"
"incident."

"Protecting your organisation's telephony systems from cyber attacks and telecoms fraud."
"Note:"
"All PBX systems should follow the NICC's Requirements on Communications Providers in relation to Customer Line Identification display services and other related services (.pdf)."
"A Private Branch Exchange (PBX) is a telecommunications system used to manage and route incoming and outgoing telephone calls within an organisation. Implementing the steps outlined in this guidance will reduce the likelihood of attackers compromising your PBX system, whether to commit fraud, instigate denial of service (Dos) attacks, or exploit telecoms channels."
"This guidance is aimed at administrators and/or procurers of PBX systems, so some knowledge of telecommunications is assumed."
"Introduction"
"As with any system that's connected to the internet, PBX systems, if not configured correctly, are at risk of being compromised by attackers. Attackers can find vulnerabilities by using scanners or by exploiting system weaknesses such as unchanged default passwords, open SIP ports, or incorrectly managed (or non-existent) firewalls."
"Once inside, criminals can route high-rate international or premium-rate numbers through the system. These attacks (also known as 'dial-through fraud') are generally prolonged and involve expensive telephone numbers being dialled hundreds or even thousands of times."

"As the PBX owner, you are responsible for the security and administration of your phone system. Your service provider may have systems in place to help detect and notify you of hacking attempts and fraud, but as the business owner you will be expected to pay the bill."
"What is a PBX?"
"A Private Branch Exchange (PBX) is a telecommunications system used to manage and route incoming and outgoing telephone calls within an organisation. In essence, a PBX serves as a private internal telephone network that allows employees to communicate both internally and externally."
"Historically, PBX systems were hardware-based systems that required physical switches and cables to connect calls within an organisation. However, with advancements in technology, PBX systems have evolved into digital and software-based solutions that offer a wide range of features beyond basic call routing. As an essential component of modern business, it is important to protect and secure the PBX from potential security threats and vulnerabilities."
"Types of PBX"
"There are several types of PBX system, each with its own characteristics and applications."
"Traditional PBX"
"Hardware-based systems that were commonly used before the rise of digital and IP- based technologies. They manage incoming and outgoing calls within an organisation using physical hardware components like switches and cables. A significant cost of installing these switches was the wiring needed to physically connect each user to the PBX equipment."
"IP PBX"
"Also known as VoIP PBX, IP PBX is a digital PBX system that uses internet protocol (IP) to transmit voice and data. These systems use the organisation's existing data network to transmit voice calls as packets of data, allowing for more efficient and cost- effective communication. IP PBX systems often offer advanced features like voicemail-to-email, video conferencing, and integration with other digital"

"communication tools. These systems can use wifi networks to reduce installation and maintenance costs."
"Hosted/cloud PBX"
"In a hosted or cloud PBX system, the PBX hardware and software are hosted by a third-party service provider off site. Organisations connect to the cloud PBX over the internet, eliminating the need for on-premises equipment. This approach is particularly attractive to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that want advanced PBX features without the infrastructure and maintenance costs."
"Virtual PBX"
"Virtual PBX is a software-based PBX solution that runs on virtualised servers. It is a subset of IP PBX systems and is often used by businesses that prefer not to invest in physical hardware. Virtual PBX can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud and offers features similar to traditional PBX systems."
"Hybrid PBX"
"These systems combine elements of both traditional and IP PBX systems. They are suitable for organisations that want to migrate to IP-based communication gradually, while still using existing analogue or digital lines."
"General mitigations for PBX systems"
"The NCSC recommend you implement the following security controls for all PBX systems."
"Secure access controls and user authentication"
". Ensure users understand the importance of strong passwords, and provide them with assistance if necessary."
". Continuously monitor and audit user accounts to identify and disable any unused or unauthorised accounts."
". Many PBX systems feature an administrative interface accessible through a specific combination of numbers and characters dialled during a call. As with administrator passwords, it's essential that you change any default values that may be in place. You should also implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access."

"11/8/24, 10:17 PM"
"Limit calls"
". Limit dialling patterns. Restrict the types of numbers and destinations that employees can dial to prevent fraud and unauthorised use. For example you may choose to disable international calling if your company does not make calls outside the UK."
". Disable the ability to call premium rate numbers or personal numbers; these usually have a high call cost. You may also choose to restrict out-of-hours calls (i.e. evenings, weekends, or holidays)."
". Restrict the ability to call forward or call transfer, especially to an off-premise number. PBXs can be configured to allow calls to be forwarded to a different number. The most common misuse of this is to route calls to premium rate or international numbers, but this service can also be abused so that the final called party sees the Customer Line Identifier (CLI) of the PBX rather than the scammer who is making the call."
"Contracts"
"\u00b7 Scrutiny of contractual terms is essential to safeguard against potential pitfalls, such as hidden charges or exorbitant fees. Thoroughly examine the contract before signing to ensure transparency and protect yourself from unintended financial consequences."
". Ensure your contracts are clear on responsibilities and that these are covered in the contract. For example, if you have a managed service and a configuration is exploited, who is responsible for the fraud?"
"Monitoring and logging"
". Use network monitoring tools to track call volumes, call patterns, and system performance. This helps in identifying unusual activity or potential security breaches."
". Store log files securely to help with forensic analysis in case of a security incident."
"Password management"

"\u00b7 Change default passwords for all on-premises PBX components and devices. Ensure passwords are strong, if necessary by adopting NCSC password strategies."
"Firewall and intrusion detection/prevention"
". Use firewalls to control network traffic and prevent unauthorised access to the PBX system."
"\u00b7 PBXs should have inbound/outbound traffic completely locked down to trusted IPs (that is, those of SIP trunk providers, clients and other trusted IPs). Where applicable use permit= and deny= lines in the SIP configuration file to limit IP address access, and prevent easy SIP scanning by setting alwaysauthreject=yes."
"\u00b7 Implement an intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) to detect and respond to suspicious network activities and potential security threats."
"Regular updates and patches"
". Keep the PBX system up to date with the latest security patches and updates to protect against known vulnerabilities. This includes the software and firmware running on the PBX itself and for VoIP phone components. Set up automatic updates where possible."
"Encryption"
". Implement encryption for both data in transit and data at rest within the on- premises PBX system. Use secure transport protocols (TLS) for communication between PBX components."
"Regular backups"
". Regularly schedule backups of the PBX configuration and data to ensure data integrity and facilitate disaster recovery in case of hardware failure or cyber attacks."
"Regular security audits and penetration testing"

"11/8/24, 10:17 PM"
". Regularly conduct security audits and assess the PBX system's security posture to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses."
"\u00b7 Perform penetration tests to simulate potential cyber attacks and address any identified vulnerabilities."
"Disaster recovery planning"
". Create a comprehensive plan outlining the steps to restore the PBX system in case of hardware failures, natural disasters, or cyber attacks."
". Test and practice your response to a variety of cyber attacks using the NCSC's 'Exercise in a Box' tool."
"Employee education and awareness"
"Provide regular security training to employees to educate them about potential security threats and best practices to follow. Ensure that all relevant employees know how to recognise and respond to signs of PBX fraud such as:"
". repeated calls of short duration"
"\u00b7 high numbers of incoming hung up calls"
". unexpected increases of incoming calls where the caller hangs up when answered"
". the sudden increase of freephone usage or high-cost destinations"
". long duration calls"
"\u00b7 changes in after-hours calling patterns"
"In addition, companies should establish a dedicated and easily accessible reporting channel to ensure all employees have a clear and confidential way to voice their concerns."

"As with all cloud services, you should choose and assess your provider in line with our cloud security guidance. In addition, we recommend that you specifically consider the following security controls for cloud/hosted PBX systems:"
"\u00b7 Verify that the provider offers automatic updates to keep your system protected against known vulnerabilities."
"\u00b7 Confirm that your cloud/hosted PBX provider employs encryption for data in transit and data at rest within their system, and implement encryption protocols like TLS for signalling and SRTP for media streams. This ensures that voice communications are secure and protected against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks."
"Specific mitigations for on-premise PBX systems"
"The NCSC recommend you implement the following security controls for on- premise PBX systems."
". Isolate the PBX by placing it on a separate VLAN or subnet to separate it from other network components. This prevents unauthorised access from other parts of the network."
". It is cheaper and quicker for a supplier to install a PBX 'straight out of the box', with no bespoke configuration. These can leave the bill payer with a service that can be exploited at their expense. Where possible, stipulate in the contract that the provider will bear responsibility for any losses resulting from the exploitation of a misconfiguration in the PBX."
". Store backups in a secure, off-site location to prevent data loss due to on- premises disasters. Backups are an essential part of an organisation's response and recovery process. See the NCSC guidance on principles for ransomware-resistant cloud backups"

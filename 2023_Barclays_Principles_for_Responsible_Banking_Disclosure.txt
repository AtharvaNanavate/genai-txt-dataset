This includes financing of climate and environmental solutions including green mortgages, energy efficient technology and renewable energy, as well as financing for broader social and sustainability work - including sustainability-linked structures and areas such as affordable housing. We are also facilitating\nfunding into green technologies and low-carbon infrastructure projects, as well as using our advisory capabilities, product sets and financial expertise to help our customers and clients realise their own transitions to a low-carbon economy.\n\u00b7 UK Modern Slavery Act 2015\nThe inclusion of transition financing in this target reflects our recognition of the importance of supporting the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors that are carbon intensive.

The Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio targets investments that could potentially catalyse transformative breakthroughs in technology, infrastructure and scalable practices.\nOur aim is to bridge financing gaps and support the acceleration and scalability of solutions to environmental challenges.\nHow our sustainable financing supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet - now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 SDGs, which are a call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. Barclays is pleased to play its part, working in partnership with our stakeholders to support the delivery of the SDGs.\nSince 2018 we have tracked our annual contribution to the SDGs through our financing activities. An illustrative breakdown of how our social and environmental financing contributes to the SDGs is provided on page 106 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023. Our financing covers a range of financing activities including debt and equity capital markets, corporate lending, trade finance and consumer lending. It helps to generate positive social and environmental outcomes through financing of activities such as, but not limited to, energy efficiency, renewable energy, affordable housing, basic infrastructure and services. Financing of activities set out in the Barclays Sustainable Finance Framework (SFF) in turn supports progress towards achieving the SDGs. For a full list of eligible social and environmental activities see the Barclays SFF, which shows how eligible social and environmental activities contribute to individual SDGs - supported through an analysis of the underlying SDG targets. As we evolve our understanding of how our financing contributes to the SDGs, we will refine our methodology accordingly.\nBeyond our financing activities, our community programmes contribute to Goal 8: decent work and economic growth.\nOur approach to nature and biodiversity\nNature is a key sustainability focus for Barclays and the wider industry going forward, given that nature and its ecosystem services fundamentally underpin economies and societies. Nature is also important to the banking sector due to the interlinkages with climate change and social impacts, with disclosure requirements moving towards a holistic approach to nature, climate and social risks and opportunities. During 2023 nature loss continued to be recognised within new and emerging guidance and regulation. Significantly for companies and financial institutions, the TNFD finalised its framework for organisations to assess and disclose nature-related risks and opportunities. Upcoming disclosure requirements on nature-related topics were confirmed under the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, as well as within guidance published by Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) regarding incorporating nature-related impacts and dependencies associated with climate transition plans. We recognise the important role of the finance sector in contributing to a nature-positive future. We continue to work to build an understanding of the ways in which our activities and those of our clients impact and depend on nature. This includes engaging with industry and cross-sector groups. We continue to explore how to integrate these considerations into policy and process and reviewing the ways our financing activities can contribute to the nature transition.\nPrinciple 1\nPrinciple 2 Principle 3\nPrinciple 4\nPrinciple 5\nPrinciple 6 Annex\nBarclays PLC Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) 2023\n05\nPrinciple 1 (continued)\nReporting and self-assessment requirements\nResponse\nReferences for further details and full descriptions\n1.2 Strategy alignment (continued)\nNature-related risk in financing\nWe include financing restrictions that seek to address nature-related risk within our position statements on Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands, and Climate Change. We continue to review and monitor how we can strengthen our approach. In 2023 we undertook a significant update of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement to expand the scope to include, for the first time, strict requirements for companies producing or processing South American beef - and strengthened requirements for companies producing or processing timber, palm oil and soy.\nWe have continued to develop our approach to evaluating nature-related risk in financing. This included building on work across 2022-23 in which we piloted the TNFD Framework on our lending portfolio for Agriculture and Food in Europe, with a focus on UK farming - in which Barclays has a significant presence. The results informed development of new questions for the Client Transition Tool (CTT) for UK farmers. In recognition of nature-related impacts identified in the agricultural value chain, we also strengthened our approach to financing agricultural commodity sectors exposed to significant deforestation risk.\nNature-related financing\nNature-related financing presents significant future opportunities for the financial sector, given the capital requirements to address and reverse nature loss. The biodiversity financing gap is estimated to be in the region of $700bn per year1 .\nWe will continue to work towards meeting our green and sustainable finance targets, which include financing relevant to nature.\nOur Sustainable Finance Framework includes categories such as 'Sustainable Food, Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture and Fisheries, which we have mapped to nature-related UN SDGs - including SDG 14, Life Under Water, and SDG 15, Life on Land.\nIn Barclays UK we believe the nature transition is a key area where we can make an impact due to our prominent role in financing UK agriculture and agricultural land purchases. In 2023 examples of nature-related financing have included lending funds in relation to the Biodiversity Net Gain scheme and support for farmers who seek to apply more sustainable farming practices.\nWe are further supporting start-ups, focusing on technologies targeting sustainable agriculture and nature, through our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio, led by Barclays' Principal Investments team. We are also exploring nature-related products and solutions for our clients in the Corporate and Investment Bank.\nJust transition\nBarclays seeks to support a just transition which accounts for the potential social risks as well as opportunities of the energy transition and seeks effective dialogue with relevant stakeholders.\nWe have taken steps to pilot the approach to a just transition in our Client Transition Framework, and will consider the findings of the pilot in our engagement with clients. We also intend to include social considerations as we develop our transition plan.\nWe believe that industry engagement is essential to advance our collective understanding and strategy to ensure a just transition. As such, we intend to continue to work with peers and industry groups, and we have become founding members of the LSE Just Transition Finance Lab to help shape the way just transition is defined and implemented in the financial sector.\nBasic current account\nSince 2015, we have been offering our basic current account to individuals who may not be eligible for a standard account access to banking, including over the counter services, access to ATMs, and digital banking and free text alerts to manage finances. There were over 650,000 Barclays basic current accounts open at the end of 2023.\nAccess to a transactional bank account enables consumers to benefit from bill reductions through paying by direct debit and access to\ncheaper goods and services on the internet, to help them along their financial journey. If their circumstances change, customers on the basic current account are able to apply for a standard Barclays current account at any time. Periodically we also review accounts to upgrade customers from Basic current account to Barclays Bank account where eligible.\n1 cbd.int/doc/c/e6d3/cd1d/daf663719a03902a9b116c34/cop-15-l-25-en.pdf\nPrinciple 1\nPrinciple 2\nPrinciple 3\nPrinciple 4\nPrinciple 5 Principle 6 Annex\n06\nBarclays PLC Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) 2023\nPrinciple 2\nPrinciple 2: Impact and Target Setting\nWe will continuously increase our positive impacts while reducing the negative impacts on, and managing the risks to, people and environment resulting from our activities, products and services.

Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving and differ in some ways from more traditional areas of reporting in the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to disclosure of such matters. Our disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, including evolving stakeholder views, and longer time-frames for assessing potential risks and impacts having regard to international long-term climate and nature-based policy goals. Our climate and sustainability-related disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness, and in relation to the use of estimates and assumptions and the application and development of methodologies. These factors means disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops. d) The data reported in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report does not form a part of the PRB assurance engagement.\nNotes:\n2. That means that where the initial impact analysis has been carried out in a previous period, the information should be updated accordingly, the scope expanded as well as the quality of the impact analysis improved over time.\n3.

Given the data challenges we have encountered while using the UNEP FI's impact analysis tool we will, in future years, use the outputs of the 'impact materiality' part of a double materiality assessment to meet Principle 2.1 of the PRB requirements. This will enable us to assess impact across all material parts of the business and product sets, while also enabling us to meet upcoming regulatory requirements.\nanalysis. This step aims to put your bank's portfolio impacts into the context of society's needs.

Please describe how you assessed the performance of these, using appropriate indicators related to significant impact areas that apply to your bank's context. In determining priority areas for target-setting among its areas of most significant impact, you should consider the bank's current performance levels, i.e. qualitative and/or quantitative indicators and/or proxies of the social, economic and environmental impacts resulting from the bank's activities and provision of products and services.

Blue Track\u2122 starts by selecting a benchmark for a sector that defines how financed emissions for a portfolio need to change over time, in line with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement - consistent with scenarios limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C. We measure the financed emissions within a selected boundary for a sector, then aggregate these into a portfolio-level metric - which is then compared to the benchmark. The Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 provides an update on progress towards achieving our previously announced 2025 and 2030 Blue Track sector targets. In 2023 and cumulatively, there are a number of drivers behind the changes in our portfolio emissions, including changes in our financing across both our lending and capital markets financing activity, our clients' emissions, client data and metrics such as company valuation, and other data inputs and methodology updates as defined in our Blue Track\u2122 Financed Emissions Methodology document. We expect to continue to see these impact our metrics in the future as data availability and quality, methodologies, guidance, and best practices for calculating our financed emissions metrics -all of which include differing levels of estimation- will continue to evolve and be refined.\na) When we first developed Blue Track\u2122, the best available scenario to develop Paris-aligned benchmarks for our financing portfolios was the International Energy Agency's Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) which was aligned to a 1.7\u2103 world. The 2025 targets set for the Energy and Power sectors were informed by the SDS scenario.\nPrinciple 1\nPrinciple 2\nPrinciple 3\nPrinciple 4\nPrinciple 5 Principle 6 Annex\n13\nBarclays PLC Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) 2023\nPrinciple 3\nPrinciple 3: Clients and Customers\nWe will work responsibly with our clients and our customers to encourage sustainable practices and enable economic activities that create shared prosperity for current\nand future generations.\nReporting and self-assessment requirements\nResponse\nReferences for further details and full descriptions\n3.1 Client engagement\nClient Transition Framework (CTF)\nBarclays PLC Annual Report 2023\nDoes your bank have a policy or engagement process with clients and customers11 in place to\nThe CTF, first piloted in 2022, supports our evaluation of our corporate clients' current and expected future progress as they transition to a low-carbon business model.\n.

This is alongside investment in our future pipeline of colleague skills through a newly created apprenticeship programme. A communications campaign informed colleagues of how Barclays is responding to climate change and sustainability more broadly, reinforcing how they can take action - including building their knowledge and skills in this area.\nDuring 2023 a mandatory online Climate risk training module was provided to 12,306 colleagues across Risk, Compliance, Internal Audit, Markets Post Trade and Business Banking. This training focused on the elevation of climate to a Principal Risk. In addition, a separate mandatory training module on Sustainability, ESG and Climate risk was delivered to 15,319 colleagues in 2023 across the Corporate and Investment Bank, Trade and Working Capital, Wholesale Onboarding and Group FCO, Finance, Compliance and Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility - further developing colleagues' knowledge of the core elements of ESG. This module focused on how Barclays manages Climate risk, as well as covering the Group sustainability-related statements and internal standards and how they should be applied. We also collaborated with external suppliers to deliver accredited development programmes for teams seeking to build specialist sustainability knowledge. For example, a development programme began in 2023 for 300 Corporate Bank colleagues in our Sustainability Academy pilot to develop their climate and sustainability knowledge. We intend to support more Corporate Banking colleagues through the programme during 2024. In addition, we delivered training to colleagues in Business Banking on strategies for supporting SME customers on their transition to net zero. In Q3 2023 Sustainability September, a communications campaign across the organisation helped engage colleagues on key sustainability-related topics. This included short videos, a series of live recorded conversations with senior leaders, and associated reading materials.\nTo ensure our workforce of the future is well positioned to understand Climate risk, in November 2023 we introduced a new Sustainability Apprenticeship - targeting internal colleagues and working in partnership with an external provider. The apprenticeship is one of six selected by industry experts to mark His Majesty The King's Coronation, gaining recognition for educating people to understand and develop ways to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. This will encourage the building of a long-term pipeline of knowledge throughout Barclays. Incentives\nFor the Executive Directors of Barclays PLC, an element of each of their annual bonus awards and Long Term Incentive Plan awards is driven by non-financial performance measures - including measures relating to climate and sustainability.\nBarclays' performance against non-financial measures, including ESG metrics, is also explicitly considered in the determination of the incentive pool - directly impacting pay levels of the wider workforce.\nNon-financial performance for the Executive Directors' 2023 annual bonus and the 2023 incentives pool was assessed against three categories: Customers and Clients; Colleagues; and Climate and Sustainability. The latter included climate-related measures such as performance against our Sustainable and Transition Financing target, financed emissions reduction targets, carbon footprint reduction, and increase in renewable energy usage - as well as measures relating to our investment in communities.\nPrinciple 1\nPrinciple 2\nPrinciple 3\nPrinciple 4\nPrinciple 5 Principle 6 Annex\n20\nBarclays PLC Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) 2023\nPrinciple 5 (continued)\nReporting and self-assessment requirements\nResponse\nReferences for further details and full descriptions\n5.3 Policies and due diligence processes\nRestrictive policies\nBarclays PLC Annual Report 2023\nDoes your bank have policies in place that\nIn addition to setting sector-specific emission reduction targets, consistent with our Purpose and driven by consideration of all\n.

In 2024 we have updated the Climate Change Statement to include new requirements for upstream oil and gas and restrictions on the type of exposures and risk we will finance going forward, as well as additional restrictions on financing in relation to the Amazon Biome, ultra-deep water and extra heavy oil.\nStatements and policy positions\nthe governance structures you have in place to oversee these risks.\nBarclays will continue to support an energy sector in transition, focusing on the diversified energy companies investing in low carbon and with greater scrutiny on those engaged in developing new upstream oil and gas projects.\nThe experience of the last few years leads us to recognise that client transition pathways will vary and the ability of our clients to meet our requirements may be affected (positively or negatively) by external factors, including, for example, the public policy and regulatory environment, technological advancement, geopolitical or regional developments, energy security, cost of living and just transition factors. We intend to continue to work with and support our clients as they transition their businesses and will monitor and engage with them on their progress and the impact of external factors over time, through our Enhanced Due Diligence and Client Transition Framework.\nFurther restrictions are set out in our Position Statements in relation to World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands and Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, as well as our statements on the Defence and Security sector, Human Rights and Modern Slavery. Enhanced Due Diligence Our standards currently include an enhanced due diligence approach for certain clients operating in the following energy sub-sectors covered by our Climate Change Statement: thermal coal mining, coal-fired power generation, mountain-top coal removal, oil sands, Arctic oil & gas and hydraulic fracturing ('fracking') and clients in-scope of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands and Defence and Security standards where a similar approach is taken. This approach will be extended to cover the additional sectors brought into scope of the updated Climate Change Statement. All clients in-scope of the above mentioned standards must be assessed annually via a detailed Sustainability enhanced due diligence questionnaire, which is used to evaluate their performance on a range of environmental and social issues and may be supplemented by a review of client policies / procedures, further client engagement and adverse media checks as appropriate. This annual review either generates an Environmental and Social Impact (ESI) risk rating (low, medium, high), or in the case of Defence and Security an assessment against risk appetite, which in turn determines whether further review and client engagement may be required throughout the year. High and certain medium ESI-rated clients would require further risk assessment prior to execution of transactions with those clients.

This limited our analysis to certain geographies and sectors, as NACE code mapping is currently only available for balance sheet elements where there was a regulatory need. Given the data challenges we have encountered while using the UNEP Fl's impact analysis tool we will, in future years, use the outputs of the 'impact materiality' part of a double materiality assessment to meet principle 2.1 of the PRB requirements. This will enable us to assess impact across all material parts of the business and product sets, while also enabling us to meet upcoming regulatory requirements.\nNotes\n15.

Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and sustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and sustainability disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards.\nThese factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate and sustainability disclosures. We give no assurance as to the likelihood of the achievement or reasonableness of any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns contained in our climate and sustainability disclosures and make no commitment to revise or update any such disclosures to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of such statements.\nDisclaimers\nIn preparing the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure wherever it appears, we have:\na. Made certain key judgements, estimations and assumptions. This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and sustainability metrics, measurement of climate risk and scenario analysis\nb. Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and methodologies made available by third parties (over which we have no control) and which may have been prepared using a range of different methodologies, or where the basis of preparation may not be known to us. Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies are subject to future risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Climate and sustainability disclosures in this document, including climate and sustainability-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information and use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate and sustainability disclosures are also not subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data cannot be relied on as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis\nc. Continued (and will continue) to review and develop our approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with market principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and methodologies used (including those made available by third parties) and the judgements, estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure. Further, changes in external factors which are outside of our control such as accounting and/or reporting standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/or updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact - potentially materially - the performance metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in this disclosure. In future disclosures we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties) using updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies, market practices or standards. Equally, we may need to re-baseline, restate, revise, recalculate or recalibrate performance against targets, convergence points or milestones on the basis of such updated data. Such updated information may result in different outcomes than those included in this disclosure. It is important for readers and users of this disclosure to be aware that direct, like-for-like comparisons of each piece of information disclosed may not always be possible from one reporting period to another. The \"Implementing our climate strategy\" section of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 highlights where information in respect of a previous reporting period has been updated. Our principles-based approach to reporting financed emissions data (see page 84 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023) sets out when financed emissions information in respect of a prior year will be identified and explained.\nKPMG LLP has performed limited independent assurance over selected climate and sustainability content, which has been marked with the symbol 4. The assurance engagement was planned and performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance of Greenhouse Gas Statements. A limited assurance opinion was issued and is available at the website link below. This includes details of the scope, reporting criteria, respective responsibilities, work performed, limitations and conclusion. No other information in this disclosure, other than our responses to criteria 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 5.1 which have been marked with the symbol A has been subject to this external limited assurance. There are a variety of internal and external factors which may impact our reported metrics and progress against our targets, convergence points and milestones.\nPrinciple 1\nPrinciple 2\nPrinciple 3\nPrinciple 4\nPrinciple 4\nPrinciple 6\nAnnex\nBarclays PLC Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB)\n28\nForward-looking statements\nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance, and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but may also be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group, including during management presentations, in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions - including policy on dividends and share buybacks - return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets - including ESG commitments and targets - plans and objectives for future operations, and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation; regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices, and the interpretation thereof; changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital markets; market-related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on European and global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security breaches, technology failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control.\nAs a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. Without limitation, in setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macroeconomic environment, including inflation, interest and unemployment rates, the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors that may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023.\nSubject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction - including, without limitation, the UK and the US - in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nBARCLAYS\nBarclays PLC 2024 Registered office: 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP Registered in England.

"Sustainable Impact Capital"
"Our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio, managed by the Barclays Principal Investments team in Treasury, has a mandate to invest up"
"to \u00a3500m into global climate technology companies by the end of 2027 - helping support our clients' transition towards a low-carbon"
"economy."
"We aim to drive change by strategically investing in visionary early-stage climate tech companies paving the way for solutions in clean"
"energy and a reduction in GHG emissions. The Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio targets investments that could potentially catalyse"
"transformative breakthroughs in technology, infrastructure and scalable practices."
"Our aim is to bridge financing gaps and support the acceleration and scalability of solutions to environmental challenges."
"How our sustainable financing supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"
"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for"
"peace and prosperity for people and the planet - now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 SDGs, which are a call for action by all"
"countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. Barclays is pleased to play its part, working in partnership with our"
"stakeholders to support the delivery of the SDGs."
"Since 2018 we have tracked our annual contribution to the SDGs through our financing activities. An illustrative breakdown of how our"
"social and environmental financing contributes to the SDGs is provided on page 106 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023."
"Our financing covers a range of financing activities including debt and equity capital markets, corporate lending, trade finance and"
"consumer lending. It helps to generate positive social and environmental outcomes through financing of activities such as, but not"
"limited to, energy efficiency, renewable energy, affordable housing, basic infrastructure and services. Financing of activities set out in"
"the Barclays Sustainable Finance Framework (SFF) in turn supports progress towards achieving the SDGs."
"For a full list of eligible social and environmental activities see the Barclays SFF, which shows how eligible social and environmental"
"activities contribute to individual SDGs - supported through an analysis of the underlying SDG targets. As we evolve our understanding"
"of how our financing contributes to the SDGs, we will refine our methodology accordingly."
"Beyond our financing activities, our community programmes contribute to Goal 8: decent work and economic growth."
"Our approach to nature and biodiversity"
"Nature is a key sustainability focus for Barclays and the wider industry going forward, given that nature and its ecosystem services"
"fundamentally underpin economies and societies. Nature is also important to the banking sector due to the interlinkages with climate"
"change and social impacts, with disclosure requirements moving towards a holistic approach to nature, climate and social risks and"
"opportunities. During 2023 nature loss continued to be recognised within new and emerging guidance and regulation. Significantly for"
"companies and financial institutions, the TNFD finalised its framework for organisations to assess and disclose nature-related risks and"
"opportunities. Upcoming disclosure requirements on nature-related topics were confirmed under the EU Corporate Sustainability"
"Reporting Directive, as well as within guidance published by Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) regarding incorporating nature-related"
"impacts and dependencies associated with climate transition plans."
"We recognise the important role of the finance sector in contributing to a nature-positive future. We continue to work to build an"
"understanding of the ways in which our activities and those of our clients impact and depend on nature. This includes engaging with"
"industry and cross-sector groups. We continue to explore how to integrate these considerations into policy and process and reviewing"
"the ways our financing activities can contribute to the nature transition."

"Nature-related risk in financing"
"We include financing restrictions that seek to address nature-related risk within our position statements on Forestry and Agricultural"
"Commodities, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands, and Climate Change. We continue to review and monitor how we can"
"strengthen our approach. In 2023 we undertook a significant update of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement to"
"expand the scope to include, for the first time, strict requirements for companies producing or processing South American beef - and"
"strengthened requirements for companies producing or processing timber, palm oil and soy."
"We have continued to develop our approach to evaluating nature-related risk in financing. This included building on work across"
"2022-23 in which we piloted the TNFD Framework on our lending portfolio for Agriculture and Food in Europe, with a focus on UK"
"farming - in which Barclays has a significant presence. The results informed development of new questions for the Client Transition"
"Tool (CTT) for UK farmers. In recognition of nature-related impacts identified in the agricultural value chain, we also strengthened our"
"approach to financing agricultural commodity sectors exposed to significant deforestation risk."
"Nature-related financing"
"Nature-related financing presents significant future opportunities for the financial sector, given the capital requirements to address and"
"reverse nature loss. The biodiversity financing gap is estimated to be in the region of $700bn per year1"
"."
"We will continue to work towards meeting our green and sustainable finance targets, which include financing relevant to nature."
"Our Sustainable Finance Framework includes categories such as 'Sustainable Food, Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture and Fisheries,"
"which we have mapped to nature-related UN SDGs - including SDG 14, Life Under Water, and SDG 15, Life on Land."
"In Barclays UK we believe the nature transition is a key area where we can make an impact due to our prominent role in financing UK"
"agriculture and agricultural land purchases. In 2023 examples of nature-related financing have included lending funds in relation to the"
"Biodiversity Net Gain scheme and support for farmers who seek to apply more sustainable farming practices."
"We are further supporting start-ups, focusing on technologies targeting sustainable agriculture and nature, through our Sustainable"
"Impact Capital portfolio, led by Barclays' Principal Investments team. We are also exploring nature-related products and solutions for"
"our clients in the Corporate and Investment Bank."
"Just transition"
"Barclays seeks to support a just transition which accounts for the potential social risks as well as opportunities of the energy transition"
"and seeks effective dialogue with relevant stakeholders."
"We have taken steps to pilot the approach to a just transition in our Client Transition Framework, and will consider the findings of the"
"pilot in our engagement with clients. We also intend to include social considerations as we develop our transition plan."
"We believe that industry engagement is essential to advance our collective understanding and strategy to ensure a just transition. As"
"such, we intend to continue to work with peers and industry groups, and we have become founding members of the LSE Just Transition"
"Finance Lab to help shape the way just transition is defined and implemented in the financial sector."
"Basic current account"
"Since 2015, we have been offering our basic current account to individuals who may not be eligible for a standard account access to"
"banking, including over the counter services, access to ATMs, and digital banking and free text alerts to manage finances. There were"
"over 650,000 Barclays basic current accounts open at the end of 2023."
"Access to a transactional bank account enables consumers to benefit from bill reductions through paying by direct debit and access to"
"cheaper goods and services on the internet, to help them along their financial journey. If their circumstances change, customers on the"
"basic current account are able to apply for a standard Barclays current account at any time. Periodically we also review accounts to"
"upgrade customers from Basic current account to Barclays Bank account where eligible."

"c) What is important to our investors and stakeholders evolves over time and we aim to anticipate and respond to these changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate"
"change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving and differ in some ways from more traditional areas of reporting in the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the"
"information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to disclosure of such matters. Our"
"disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, including evolving stakeholder views, and longer time-frames for assessing potential risks and impacts"
"having regard to international long-term climate and nature-based policy goals. Our climate and sustainability-related disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures"
"relating to other subjects given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness, and in relation to the use of estimates and assumptions and the"
"application and development of methodologies. These factors means disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and"
"availability develops."
"d) The data reported in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report does not form a part of the PRB assurance engagement."
"Notes:"
"2. That means that where the initial impact analysis has been carried out in a previous period, the information should be updated accordingly, the scope expanded as well as the quality of the impact analysis improved over time."
"3. Further guidance can be found in the Interactive Guidance on impact analysis and target setting."
"4. 'Key sectors' relative to different impact areas, i.e. those sectors whose positive and negative impacts are particularly strong, are particularly relevant here."

"Real Estate'"
"Notes:"
"5 Global priorities might alternatively be considered for banks with highly diversified and international portfolios."
"6 To prioritize the areas of most significant impact, a qualitative overlay to the quantitative analysis as described in a), b) and c) will be important, e.g. through stakeholder engagement and further geographic contextualisation."
"7 You can respond \"Yes\" to a question if you have completed one of the described steps, e.g. the initial impact analysis has been carried out, a pilot has been conducted."
"8 Operational targets (relating to for example water consumption in office buildings, gender equality on the bank's management board or business-trip related greenhouse gas emissions) are not in scope of the PRB."
"9 Your bank should consider the main challenges and priorities in terms of sustainable development in your main country/ies of operation for the purpose of setting targets. These can be found in National Development Plans and strategies, international goals such as the SDGs or the Paris Climate Agreement,"
"and regional frameworks. Aligning means there should be a clear link between the bank's targets and these frameworks and priorities, therefore showing how the target supports and drives contributions to the national and global goals."

"indicators used as well as the year of the"

"In December 2022 we announced a new target, to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Financing between 2023 and the end of"
"2030"
"You can build upon the performance"
"measurement undertaken in 2.1 to determine"
"the baseline for your target."
"A package of indicators has been developed for"
"Our $1trn target encompasses the green, social, transition and broader sustainability-linked financing requirements of clients including"
"corporates, governments and the public sector, financial institutions and consumers. This includes financing of climate and"
"environmental solutions including sustainable food and agriculture, sustainable water management, affordable housing and affordable"
"basic infrastructure."
"climate change mitigation and financial health &"
"inclusion to guide and support banks in their"
"target setting and implementation journey. The"
"overview of indicators can be found in the"
"The inclusion of transition financing in this target reflects our recognition of the importance of supporting the decarbonisation of"
"hard-to-abate sectors that are carbon intensive. In early 2024 we announced our Transition Finance Framework (TFF), which outlines"
"the criteria for transactions to qualify as transition financing and sits alongside our Sustainable Finance Framework (SFF) to define what"
"can be included against this target."
"Annex of this template."
"During 2023 we facilitated $67.8bn4 of Sustainable and Transition Financing. Further details relating to breakdown by category, region"
"and product type can be found in the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 on page 103. Details of how our social and environmental"
"financing aligns to the UN SDGs can also be found in the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 on page 106\u00aa."
"If your bank has prioritized climate mitigation"
"and/or financial health & inclusion as (one of)"
"your most significant impact areas, it is strongly"
"Unreasonable Impact"
"recommended to report on the indicators in the"
"Annex, using an overview table like below"
"including the impact area, all relevant indicators"
"and the corresponding indicator codes:"
"Since 2016, through its Unreasonable Impact programme, Barclays has supported over 300 high-growth entrepreneurs that seek to"
"address pressing social and environmental challenges by connecting them with a network of mentors and industry specialists, including"
"experts from across Barclays. Barclays will support an additional 200 entrepreneurs over five years through the Unreasonable Impact"
"programme. In 2023 we supported 414 ventures."
"In case you have identified other and/or"
"additional indicators as relevant to determine"
"the baseline and assess the level of alignment"
"towards impact driven targets, please disclose"
"With billions in financing already raised by the companies that have participated in the programme, the partnership's momentum"
"continues to grow - and the ventures are driving innovations in a variety of industries from food and agriculture to energy and"
"manufacturing."
"these."
"LifeSkills"
"c) SMART targets (incl. key performance"
"indicators (KPIs)10: Please disclose the targets"
"We believe everyone deserves the financial independence, security and opportunity that comes with a job - and a vibrant, skilled"
"workforce ensures local communities and businesses can thrive."
"for your first and your second area of most"
"significant impact, if already in place (as well as"
"further impact areas, if in place). Which KPIs"
"are you using to monitor progress towards"
"reaching the target? Please disclose."
"Barclays' LifeSkills programme has been delivering a positive impact in UK communities for a decade, helping millions of people develop"
"the vital employability and financial skills they need to succeed at work, thrive in the digital age and better manage their money. Through"
"the next chapter of our LifeSkills programme, Barclays has committed to upskilling 8.7 million people and placing 250,000 people into"
"work by the end of 2027. In 2023 we upskilled 2.6 million people and placed over 53,5004 people into work."
"Mitigating significant impacts"
"d) Action plan: which actions including"
"milestones have you defined to meet the set"
"Restrictive policies"
"targets? Please describe."
"Please also show that your bank has analysed"
"and acknowledged significant (potential)"
"In addition to setting our PRB-aligned targets, consistent with our Purpose and driven by consideration of all relevant risks and other"
"factors, we have set explicit restrictions to curtail or prohibit financing of certain activities in sensitive sectors. These policies can be"
"found in our policy and position statements online."
"indirect impacts of the set targets within the"
"Just transition"
"impact area or on other impact areas and that it"
"has set out relevant actions to avoid, mitigate,"
"or compensate potential negative impacts."
"Barclays seeks to support a just transition which accounts for the potential social risks as well as opportunities of the energy transition"
"and seeks effective dialogue with relevant stakeholders."

"Barclays has developed and published in February 2024 the first version of the Transition Finance Framework for classifying financing as"
"'transition' for the purpose of tracking and disclosing our performance against our target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and"
"Transition Financing between 2023 and the end of 2030."
"The TFF is complementary to our Sustainable Finance Framework. The TFF augments the scope of Barclays' SFF and determines the"
"eligibility of transition activities that sit outside the sustainable finance already covered by the SFF."
"The TFF outlines the criteria for eligible transactions with a set of defined principles to guide us in the application of our definition of"
"transition finance and support high-emitting clients and finance real economy decarbonisation."
"As innovation and market principles in relation to transition finance continue to accelerate and evolve, we will continue to consider and"
"develop our definition of transition finance and the coverage under this Framework."
"BlueTrack\u2122M"
"We have developed our Blue Track\u2122 methodology to measure and track our targets, which incorporate a 1.5\u2103 scenario for our 2030"
"targets, for these high-emitting material sectors\u00aa. Blue Track\u2122 starts by selecting a benchmark for a sector that defines how financed"
"emissions for a portfolio need to change over time, in line with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement - consistent with"
"scenarios limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C. We measure the financed emissions within a selected boundary for a"
"sector, then aggregate these into a portfolio-level metric - which is then compared to the benchmark."
"The Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 provides an update on progress towards achieving our previously announced 2025 and 2030"
"Blue Track sector targets. In 2023 and cumulatively, there are a number of drivers behind the changes in our portfolio emissions,"
"including changes in our financing across both our lending and capital markets financing activity, our clients' emissions, client data and"
"metrics such as company valuation, and other data inputs and methodology updates as defined in our Blue Track\u2122 Financed Emissions"
"Methodology document. We expect to continue to see these impact our metrics in the future as data availability and quality,"
"methodologies, guidance, and best practices for calculating our financed emissions metrics -all of which include differing levels of"
"estimation- will continue to evolve and be refined."
"a) When we first developed Blue Track\u2122, the best available scenario to develop Paris-aligned benchmarks for our financing portfolios was the International Energy Agency's"
"Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) which was aligned to a 1.7\u2103 world. The 2025 targets set for the Energy and Power sectors were informed by the SDS scenario."

"We believe Barclays can make the greatest difference by supporting our clients as they transition to a low-carbon business model,"

"As trusted advisers we continue to proactively engage with our clients on the risks and opportunities for their businesses arising from"
"the transition to a low-carbon economy. This includes working with climate technology companies across their stages of development,"

"Sustainable Impact Capital Portfolio: Investing \u00a3500m into global climate tech start-ups"
"We firmly believe that innovation is key to tackling climate change and we are committed to supporting transformative change by"
"investing our own capital in entrepreneurial companies. In 2020 Barclays announced that it would invest up to \u00a3175m equity capital into"
"environmentally-focused climate technology companies by 2025 - helping support our clients to transition towards a low-carbon"
"economy, scale solutions to environmental challenges, and fill their growth-stage funding gaps."
"In evidence of the success of the investments, in December 2022 we announced an increase of the investment mandate to invest up"
"to E500m by the end of 2027."
"To date we have invested \u00a3138m into 21 innovative companies. These investments have supported many aspects of climate-tech"
"innovation, from property retrofit solutions to long-duration energy storage and hydrogen technologies."
"We continue to focus on decarbonisation technologies supporting transition within carbon-intensive sectors, particularly where"
"Barclays has meaningful client exposure - such as Power, Industry, Transport, Agriculture and Real Estate - including solutions"
"delivering carbon capture, carbon dioxide removal and green hydrogen."
"How our sustainable financing supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"
"Since 2018, we have tracked our annual contribution to the SDGs, through our financing activities. An illustrative breakdown of our"
"social and environmental financing is provided in the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023."
"Greener Home Propositions"
"Barclays UK is supporting retail mortgage customers' transition to a more sustainable way of living, providing products and propositions"
"focused on retrofitting. In 2023 we rolled out training on home energy efficiency and climate risk to our mortgage advisors and hosted a"
"webinar for mortgage brokers with retrofitting industry experts."
"We continue to support customers purchasing EPC A- and B-rated new-build homes with our Green Home Mortgage, following its"
"expansion to include buy-to-let properties in 2022. In 2023 we lent \u00a3845m to Green Home Mortgage customers. Since inception in"
"2018, Barclays UK has lent over \u00a33.5bn to Green Home Mortgage customers."

"perspectives through engagement with both internal and external stakeholders, to seek to understand the most salient human rights"
"No"
"risks to people connected to the CIB financing portfolio."
"Please describe which stakeholders (or groups/"

"with for the purpose of implementing the"
"Principles and improving your bank's impacts."
"This should include a high-level overview of how"
"your bank has identified relevant stakeholders,"
"what issues were addressed/results achieved"
"In our external engagement, we engaged with 10 civil society organisations (CSOs), selected by reference to their previous contact with"
"Barclays in relation to human rights issues, and/or their recognised expertise, in particular, on the intersection between financial"
"institutions and human rights. Engagement took place through a series of focused discussions, mostly facilitated by Shift."
"Our internal engagement included a series of workshops with colleagues from a range of functions including Sustainability, Risk,"
"Compliance, Legal and the business and across the US, UK and APAC, followed by deep dive interviews with some of these colleagues."
"and how they fed into the action planning"
"process."
"The insights gathered during this proactive engagement, complemented by insights from previous relevant engagement with CSOs, as"
"well as desk-based research by the Barclays Social Policy team and Shift, informed the identification of a long list of human rights"
"impacts."
"These impacts were then prioritised, through consideration of the relative severity of the impacts on people and their likelihood of"
"occurrence, to produce a shortlist. This list and related analysis were presented to core stakeholders to review and test the application"
"of the severity and likelihood criteria to finalise our five salient human rights issues, as set out on page 240 of the Barclays PLC Annual"
"Report 2023,"
"Engaging with industry"
"We know that leveraging the relationships we hold with stakeholders can support all of us in achieving our objectives."
"Continued engagement in the financial sector and other areas of the real economy and public sector will be important in delivering the"
"actions necessary to meet our global sustainability goals. At a minimum, strategic partnerships with key stakeholders enables"
"knowledge sharing and supports informed decision-making. Collaborating with NGOs, academia, government agencies, private sector"
"peers, and local communities enhances our ability to understand, assess, and address the intricate issues associated with climate"
"change. These partnerships have the potential to uncover opportunities to deploy capital into areas that suffer from existing financing"
"gaps and scale companies to disrupt markets and innovate for impact."

"We are aware that responding effectively to climate and sustainability issues is one of the greatest challenges facing"
"\u00b7 'Skills, culture and training' on pages 122-123"
"Describe the initiatives and measures of your businesses,investors, and society today. In 2023 we continued to educate colleagues on sustainability and climate change risk and"
"bank to foster a culture of responsible"
"opportunities, their impact on society and the Bank, and Barclays' strategy and response."
"banking among its employees (e.g., capacity"
"building, e-learning, sustainability trainings"
"for client-facing roles, inclusion in"
"remuneration structures and performance"
"As we strengthen our ESG capability and culture, our colleagues continue to build insights and expertise to help execute our Climate"
"Strategy. We have made online learning available to grow everyone's knowledge, and created upskilling for specific areas in line with"
"strategic priorities - including mandatory training and targeted development for certain teams relevant to their roles and"
"management and leadership"
"communication, amongst others)."
"responsibilities. This is alongside investment in our future pipeline of colleague skills through a newly created apprenticeship"
"programme. A communications campaign informed colleagues of how Barclays is responding to climate change and sustainability"
"more broadly, reinforcing how they can take action - including building their knowledge and skills in this area."
"During 2023 a mandatory online Climate risk training module was provided to 12,306 colleagues across Risk, Compliance, Internal"
"Audit, Markets Post Trade and Business Banking. This training focused on the elevation of climate to a Principal Risk."
"In addition, a separate mandatory training module on Sustainability, ESG and Climate risk was delivered to 15,319 colleagues in 2023"
"across the Corporate and Investment Bank, Trade and Working Capital, Wholesale Onboarding and Group FCO, Finance, Compliance"
"and Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility - further developing colleagues' knowledge of the core elements of ESG. This module"
"focused on how Barclays manages Climate risk, as well as covering the Group sustainability-related statements and internal standards"
"and how they should be applied."
"We also collaborated with external suppliers to deliver accredited development programmes for teams seeking to build specialist"
"sustainability knowledge. For example, a development programme began in 2023 for 300 Corporate Bank colleagues in our"
"Sustainability Academy pilot to develop their climate and sustainability knowledge. We intend to support more Corporate Banking"
"colleagues through the programme during 2024. In addition, we delivered training to colleagues in Business Banking on strategies for"
"supporting SME customers on their transition to net zero."
"In Q3 2023 Sustainability September, a communications campaign across the organisation helped engage colleagues on key"
"sustainability-related topics. This included short videos, a series of live recorded conversations with senior leaders, and associated"
"reading materials."
"To ensure our workforce of the future is well positioned to understand Climate risk, in November 2023 we introduced a new"
"Sustainability Apprenticeship - targeting internal colleagues and working in partnership with an external provider. The apprenticeship is"
"one of six selected by industry experts to mark His Majesty The King's Coronation, gaining recognition for educating people to"
"understand and develop ways to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. This will encourage the building of a long-term"
"pipeline of knowledge throughout Barclays."
"Incentives"
"For the Executive Directors of Barclays PLC, an element of each of their annual bonus awards and Long Term Incentive Plan awards is"
"driven by non-financial performance measures - including measures relating to climate and sustainability."
"Barclays' performance against non-financial measures, including ESG metrics, is also explicitly considered in the determination of the"
"incentive pool - directly impacting pay levels of the wider workforce."
"Non-financial performance for the Executive Directors' 2023 annual bonus and the 2023 incentives pool was assessed against three"
"categories: Customers and Clients; Colleagues; and Climate and Sustainability. The latter included climate-related measures such as"
"performance against our Sustainable and Transition Financing target, financed emissions reduction targets, carbon footprint"
"reduction, and increase in renewable energy usage - as well as measures relating to our investment in communities."

"address environmental and social risks within"
"your portfolio?"
"relevant risks and other factors, we have set explicit restrictions to curtail or prohibit financing of certain activities in sensitive sectors."
"These policies are set out in detail within our statements and policy positions."
"Statement' on pages 40-43"
"\u00b7 Restrictive policies' on page 100"
"Please describe what due diligence"
"processes your bank has installed to identify"
"and manage environmental and social risks"
"associated with your portfolio. This can"
"Our restrictive policies are regularly reviewed and updated in light of the rapidly changing external environment and are informed by"
"engagement with our stakeholders, including shareholders, clients, subject specialists and civil society groups. In 2023 this included a"
"review of nature-related impacts and dependencies and social risks of different technology types to help inform our approach to due"
"diligence."
"\u00b7 Managing impacts in lending and financing on"
"pages 236-237"
"include aspects such as identification of"
"significant/salient risks, environmental and"
"social risks mitigation and definition of action"
"plans, monitoring and reporting on risks and"
"any existing grievance mechanism, as well as"
"Our Climate Change Statement sets out our positions and approach to sensitive sectors with tightening policy criteria and increasing"
"expectations over time. In 2024 we have updated the Climate Change Statement to include new requirements for upstream oil and"
"gas and restrictions on the type of exposures and risk we will finance going forward, as well as additional restrictions on financing in"
"relation to the Amazon Biome, ultra-deep water and extra heavy oil."
"Statements and policy positions"
"the governance structures you have in place"
"to oversee these risks."
"Barclays will continue to support an energy sector in transition, focusing on the diversified energy companies investing in low carbon"
"and with greater scrutiny on those engaged in developing new upstream oil and gas projects."
"The experience of the last few years leads us to recognise that client transition pathways will vary and the ability of our clients to meet"
"our requirements may be affected (positively or negatively) by external factors, including, for example, the public policy and regulatory"
"environment, technological advancement, geopolitical or regional developments, energy security, cost of living and just transition"
"factors. We intend to continue to work with and support our clients as they transition their businesses and will monitor and engage with"
"them on their progress and the impact of external factors over time, through our Enhanced Due Diligence and Client Transition"
"Framework."
"Further restrictions are set out in our Position Statements in relation to World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands and Forestry and"
"Agricultural Commodities, as well as our statements on the Defence and Security sector, Human Rights and Modern Slavery."
"Enhanced Due Diligence"
"Our standards currently include an enhanced due diligence approach for certain clients operating in the following energy sub-sectors"
"covered by our Climate Change Statement: thermal coal mining, coal-fired power generation, mountain-top coal removal, oil sands,"
"Arctic oil & gas and hydraulic fracturing ('fracking') and clients in-scope of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage"
"Sites and Ramsar Wetlands and Defence and Security standards where a similar approach is taken. This approach will be extended to"
"cover the additional sectors brought into scope of the updated Climate Change Statement."
"All clients in-scope of the above mentioned standards must be assessed annually via a detailed Sustainability enhanced due diligence"
"questionnaire, which is used to evaluate their performance on a range of environmental and social issues and may be supplemented by"
"a review of client policies / procedures, further client engagement and adverse media checks as appropriate. This annual review either"
"generates an Environmental and Social Impact (ESI) risk rating (low, medium, high), or in the case of Defence and Security an"
"assessment against risk appetite, which in turn determines whether further review and client engagement may be required throughout"
"the year."
"High and certain medium ESI-rated clients would require further risk assessment prior to execution of transactions with those clients."
"Human Rights saliency assessment for Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB)"
"See page 16 of this report for information on our human rights saliency assessment of the CIB financing portfolio and page 240 of the"
"Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 to see a table listing our most salient human rights risks identified as part of the saliency assessment"
"Note:"
"14. Applicable examples of types of policies are: exclusion policies for certain sectors/activities; zero-deforestation policies; zero-tolerance policies; gender-related policies; social due diligence policies; stakeholder engagement policies; whistle-blower policies etc., or any applicable national guidelines related"
"to social risks."

"use the outputs of the 'impact materiality' part of a double materiality assessment to meet principle 2.1 of the PRB requirements. This"
"will enable us to assess impact across all material parts of the business and product sets, while also enabling us to meet upcoming"
"regulatory requirements."

"Disclaimer"
"Information provided in climate and sustainability disclosures"
"What is important to our investors and stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to anticipate and respond to these changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast"
"moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We"
"have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and sustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the"
"development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and"
"sustainability disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of estimates, judgements and"
"assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards."
"These factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or"
"conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate and sustainability disclosures. We give no assurance as to the likelihood of"
"the achievement or reasonableness of any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns contained in our climate and sustainability disclosures and make no commitment to revise or"
"update any such disclosures to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of such statements."
"Disclaimers"
"In preparing the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure wherever it appears, we have:"
"a. Made certain key judgements, estimations and assumptions. This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and"
"sustainability metrics, measurement of climate risk and scenario analysis"
"b. Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and"

"Forward-looking statements"
"This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to"
"the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance, and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained"
"in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue',"
"'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but may also be made verbally by directors,"
"officers and employees of the Group, including during management presentations, in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to"
"the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions - including policy on dividends and"
"share buybacks - return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets - including ESG commitments and targets - plans and objectives for future"
"operations, and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements"
"speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation; regulations, governmental and regulatory policies,"
"expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices, and the interpretation thereof; changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and"
"application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to"
"measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking"
"and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including"
"inflation; volatility in credit and capital markets; market-related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit"
"ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on European and"
"global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security breaches, technology"
"failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions."
"A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control."
"As a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in"
"the Group's forward-looking statements. Without limitation, in setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macroeconomic environment, including inflation, interest and"
"unemployment rates, the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors that may"
"impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023."
"Subject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction - including, without limitation, the UK and the US - in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation"
"to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."

"How our sustainable financing supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"
""
"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet - now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 SDGs, which are a call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. Barclays is pleased to play its part, working in partnership with our stakeholders to support the delivery of the SDGs."
"Since 2018 we have tracked our annual contribution to the SDGs through our financing activities. An illustrative breakdown of how our social and environmental financing contributes to the SDGs is provided on page 106 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023. Our financing covers a range of financing activities including debt and equity capital markets, corporate lending, trade finance and consumer lending. It helps to generate positive social and environmental outcomes through financing of activities such as, but not limited to, energy efficiency, renewable energy, affordable housing, basic infrastructure and services. Financing of activities set out in the Barclays Sustainable Finance Framework (SFF) in turn supports progress towards achieving the SDGs. For a full list of eligible social and environmental activities see the Barclays SFF, which shows how eligible social and environmental activities contribute to individual SDGs - supported through an analysis of the underlying SDG targets. As we evolve our understanding of how our financing contributes to the SDGs, we will refine our methodology accordingly."
"Beyond our financing activities, our community programmes contribute to Goal 8: decent work and economic growth."

"Our approach to nature and biodiversity"
""
"Nature is a key sustainability focus for Barclays and the wider industry going forward, given that nature and its ecosystem services fundamentally underpin economies and societies. Nature is also important to the banking sector due to the interlinkages with climate change and social impacts, with disclosure requirements moving towards a holistic approach to nature, climate and social risks and opportunities. During 2023 nature loss continued to be recognised within new and emerging guidance and regulation. Significantly for companies and financial institutions, the TNFD finalised its framework for organisations to assess and disclose nature-related risks and opportunities. Upcoming disclosure requirements on nature-related topics were confirmed under the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, as well as within guidance published by Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) regarding incorporating nature-related impacts and dependencies associated with climate transition plans. We recognise the important role of the finance sector in contributing to a nature-positive future. We continue to work to build an understanding of the ways in which our activities and those of our clients impact and depend on nature. This includes engaging with industry and cross-sector groups. We continue to explore how to integrate these considerations into policy and process and reviewing the ways our financing activities can contribute to the nature transition."

"Nature-related risk in financing"

"We include financing restrictions that seek to address nature-related risk within our position statements on Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands, and Climate Change. We continue to review and monitor how we can strengthen our approach. In 2023 we undertook a significant update of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement to expand the scope to include, for the first time, strict requirements for companies producing or processing South American beef - and strengthened requirements for companies producing or processing timber, palm oil and soy."
""
"We have continued to develop our approach to evaluating nature-related risk in financing. This included building on work across 2022-23 in which we piloted the TNFD Framework on our lending portfolio for Agriculture and Food in Europe, with a focus on UK farming - in which Barclays has a significant presence. The results informed development of new questions for the Client Transition Tool (CTT) for UK farmers. In recognition of nature-related impacts identified in the agricultural value chain, we also strengthened our approach to financing agricultural commodity sectors exposed to significant deforestation risk."
"Nature-related financing"
""
"Nature-related financing presents significant future opportunities for the financial sector, given the capital requirements to address and reverse nature loss. The biodiversity financing gap is estimated to be in the region of $700bn per year1 ."
""
"We will continue to work towards meeting our green and sustainable finance targets, which include financing relevant to nature."
""
"Our Sustainable Finance Framework includes categories such as 'Sustainable Food, Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture and Fisheries, which we have mapped to nature-related UN SDGs - including SDG 14, Life Under Water, and SDG 15, Life on Land."
""
"In Barclays UK we believe the nature transition is a key area where we can make an impact due to our prominent role in financing UK agriculture and agricultural land purchases. In 2023 examples of nature-related financing have included lending funds in relation to the Biodiversity Net Gain scheme and support for farmers who seek to apply more sustainable farming practices."
"We are further supporting start-ups, focusing on technologies targeting sustainable agriculture and nature, through our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio, led by Barclays' Principal Investments team. We are also exploring nature-related products and solutions for our clients in the Corporate and Investment Bank."
"Just transition"
""
"Barclays seeks to support a just transition which accounts for the potential social risks as well as opportunities of the energy transition and seeks effective dialogue with relevant stakeholders."
""
"We have taken steps to pilot the approach to a just transition in our Client Transition Framework, and will consider the findings of the pilot in our engagement with clients. We also intend to include social considerations as we develop our transition plan."
""
"We believe that industry engagement is essential to advance our collective understanding and strategy to ensure a just transition. As such, we intend to continue to work with peers and industry groups, and we have become founding members of the LSE Just Transition Finance Lab to help shape the way just transition is defined and implemented in the financial sector."
"Basic current account"
""
"Since 2015, we have been offering our basic current account to individuals who may not be eligible for a standard account access to banking, including over the counter services, access to ATMs, and digital banking and free text alerts to manage finances. There were over 650,000 Barclays basic current accounts open at the end of 2023."

We have adapted our approach in relation to disclosure of such matters. Our disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, including evolving stakeholder views, and longer time-frames for assessing potential risks and impacts having regard to international long-term climate and nature-based policy goals. Our climate and sustainability-related disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness, and in relation to the use of estimates and assumptions and the application and development of methodologies. These factors means disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops. d) The data reported in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report does not form a part of the PRB assurance engagement."

Blue Track\u2122 starts by selecting a benchmark for a sector that defines how financed emissions for a portfolio need to change over time, in line with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement - consistent with scenarios limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C. We measure the financed emissions within a selected boundary for a sector, then aggregate these into a portfolio-level metric - which is then compared to the benchmark. The Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 provides an update on progress towards achieving our previously announced 2025 and 2030 Blue Track sector targets. In 2023 and cumulatively, there are a number of drivers behind the changes in our portfolio emissions, including changes in our financing across both our lending and capital markets financing activity, our clients' emissions, client data and metrics such as company valuation, and other data inputs and methodology updates as defined in our Blue Track\u2122 Financed Emissions Methodology document.

This approach will be extended to cover the additional sectors brought into scope of the updated Climate Change Statement. All clients in-scope of the above mentioned standards must be assessed annually via a detailed Sustainability enhanced due diligence questionnaire, which is used to evaluate their performance on a range of environmental and social issues and may be supplemented by a review of client policies / procedures, further client engagement and adverse media checks as appropriate. This annual review either generates an Environmental and Social Impact (ESI) risk rating (low, medium, high), or in the case of Defence and Security an assessment against risk appetite, which in turn determines whether further review and client engagement may be required throughout the year. High and certain medium ESI-rated clients would require further risk assessment prior to execution of transactions with those clients.

"Sustainable Impact Capital"
"Our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio, managed by the Barclays Principal Investments team in Treasury, has a mandate to invest up to \u00a3500m into global climate technology companies by the end of 2027 - helping support our clients' transition towards a low-carbon economy."
"We aim to drive change by strategically investing in visionary early-stage climate tech companies paving the way for solutions in clean energy and a reduction in GHG emissions. The Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio targets investments that could potentially catalyse transformative breakthroughs in technology, infrastructure and scalable practices."
"Our aim is to bridge financing gaps and support the acceleration and scalability of solutions to environmental challenges."
"How our sustainable financing supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"
"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet - now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 SDGs, which are a call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. Barclays is pleased to play its part, working in partnership with our stakeholders to support the delivery of the SDGs."
"Since 2018 we have tracked our annual contribution to the SDGs through our financing activities. An illustrative breakdown of how our social and environmental financing contributes to the SDGs is provided on page 106 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023. Our financing covers a range of financing activities including debt and equity capital markets, corporate lending, trade finance and consumer lending. It helps to generate positive social and environmental outcomes through financing of activities such as, but not limited to, energy efficiency, renewable energy, affordable housing, basic infrastructure and services. Financing of activities set out in the Barclays Sustainable Finance Framework (SFF) in turn supports progress towards achieving the SDGs. For a full list of eligible social and environmental activities see the Barclays SFF, which shows how eligible social and environmental activities contribute to individual SDGs - supported through an analysis of the underlying SDG targets. As we evolve our understanding of how our financing contributes to the SDGs, we will refine our methodology accordingly."
"Beyond our financing activities, our community programmes contribute to Goal 8: decent work and economic growth."
"Our approach to nature and biodiversity"
"Nature is a key sustainability focus for Barclays and the wider industry going forward, given that nature and its ecosystem services fundamentally underpin economies and societies. Nature is also important to the banking sector due to the interlinkages with climate change and social impacts, with disclosure requirements moving towards a holistic approach to nature, climate and social risks and opportunities. During 2023 nature loss continued to be recognised within new and emerging guidance and regulation. Significantly for companies and financial institutions, the TNFD finalised its framework for organisations to assess and disclose nature-related risks and opportunities. Upcoming disclosure requirements on nature-related topics were confirmed under the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, as well as within guidance published by Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) regarding incorporating nature-related impacts and dependencies associated with climate transition plans. We recognise the important role of the finance sector in contributing to a nature-positive future. We continue to work to build an understanding of the ways in which our activities and those of our clients impact and depend on nature. This includes engaging with industry and cross-sector groups. We continue to explore how to integrate these considerations into policy and process and reviewing the ways our financing activities can contribute to the nature transition."

"Nature-related risk in financing"
"We include financing restrictions that seek to address nature-related risk within our position statements on Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands, and Climate Change. We continue to review and monitor how we can strengthen our approach. In 2023 we undertook a significant update of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement to expand the scope to include, for the first time, strict requirements for companies producing or processing South American beef - and strengthened requirements for companies producing or processing timber, palm oil and soy."
"We have continued to develop our approach to evaluating nature-related risk in financing. This included building on work across 2022-23 in which we piloted the TNFD Framework on our lending portfolio for Agriculture and Food in Europe, with a focus on UK farming - in which Barclays has a significant presence. The results informed development of new questions for the Client Transition Tool (CTT) for UK farmers. In recognition of nature-related impacts identified in the agricultural value chain, we also strengthened our approach to financing agricultural commodity sectors exposed to significant deforestation risk."
"Nature-related financing"
"Nature-related financing presents significant future opportunities for the financial sector, given the capital requirements to address and reverse nature loss. The biodiversity financing gap is estimated to be in the region of $700bn per year1 ."
"We will continue to work towards meeting our green and sustainable finance targets, which include financing relevant to nature."
"Our Sustainable Finance Framework includes categories such as 'Sustainable Food, Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture and Fisheries, which we have mapped to nature-related UN SDGs - including SDG 14, Life Under Water, and SDG 15, Life on Land."
"In Barclays UK we believe the nature transition is a key area where we can make an impact due to our prominent role in financing UK agriculture and agricultural land purchases. In 2023 examples of nature-related financing have included lending funds in relation to the Biodiversity Net Gain scheme and support for farmers who seek to apply more sustainable farming practices."
"We are further supporting start-ups, focusing on technologies targeting sustainable agriculture and nature, through our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio, led by Barclays' Principal Investments team. We are also exploring nature-related products and solutions for our clients in the Corporate and Investment Bank."
"Just transition"
"Barclays seeks to support a just transition which accounts for the potential social risks as well as opportunities of the energy transition and seeks effective dialogue with relevant stakeholders."
"We have taken steps to pilot the approach to a just transition in our Client Transition Framework, and will consider the findings of the pilot in our engagement with clients. We also intend to include social considerations as we develop our transition plan."
"We believe that industry engagement is essential to advance our collective understanding and strategy to ensure a just transition. As such, we intend to continue to work with peers and industry groups, and we have become founding members of the LSE Just Transition Finance Lab to help shape the way just transition is defined and implemented in the financial sector."
"Basic current account"
"Since 2015, we have been offering our basic current account to individuals who may not be eligible for a standard account access to banking, including over the counter services, access to ATMs, and digital banking and free text alerts to manage finances. There were over 650,000 Barclays basic current accounts open at the end of 2023."
"Access to a transactional bank account enables consumers to benefit from bill reductions through paying by direct debit and access to"
"cheaper goods and services on the internet, to help them along their financial journey. If their circumstances change, customers on the basic current account are able to apply for a standard Barclays current account at any time. Periodically we also review accounts to upgrade customers from Basic current account to Barclays Bank account where eligible."

Research: We start by gathering data and information from a broad range of sources including customer and client questionnaires, investor questionnaires, ESG ratings agencies, relevant banking industry frameworks, internal Barclays employee communications and social media listening. This research allows us to define which topics might be material to our business and develop a proxy ranking across external stakeholders."

"elaborate, to show how you have considered where the bank's core business/major activities lie in terms of industries or sectors."
"c) What is important to our investors and stakeholders evolves over time and we aim to anticipate and respond to these changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving and differ in some ways from more traditional areas of reporting in the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to disclosure of such matters. Our disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, including evolving stakeholder views, and longer time-frames for assessing potential risks and impacts having regard to international long-term climate and nature-based policy goals. Our climate and sustainability-related disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness, and in relation to the use of estimates and assumptions and the application and development of methodologies. These factors means disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops. d) The data reported in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report does not form a part of the PRB assurance engagement."

"9 Your bank should consider the main challenges and priorities in terms of sustainable development in your main country/ies of operation for the purpose of setting targets. These can be found in National Development Plans and strategies, international goals such as the SDGs or the Paris Climate Agreement, and regional frameworks. Aligning means there should be a clear link between the bank's targets and these frameworks and priorities, therefore showing how the target supports and drives contributions to the national and global goals."

The TFF is complementary to our Sustainable Finance Framework. The TFF augments the scope of Barclays' SFF and determines the"
"eligibility of transition activities that sit outside the sustainable finance already covered by the SFF."
"The TFF outlines the criteria for eligible transactions with a set of defined principles to guide us in the application of our definition of transition finance and support high-emitting clients and finance real economy decarbonisation."
"As innovation and market principles in relation to transition finance continue to accelerate and evolve, we will continue to consider and develop our definition of transition finance and the coverage under this Framework."
"BlueTrack\u2122M"
"We have developed our Blue Track\u2122 methodology to measure and track our targets, which incorporate a 1.5\u2103 scenario for our 2030 targets, for these high-emitting material sectors\u00aa. Blue Track\u2122 starts by selecting a benchmark for a sector that defines how financed emissions for a portfolio need to change over time, in line with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement - consistent with scenarios limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C. We measure the financed emissions within a selected boundary for a sector, then aggregate these into a portfolio-level metric - which is then compared to the benchmark. The Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 provides an update on progress towards achieving our previously announced 2025 and 2030 Blue Track sector targets. In 2023 and cumulatively, there are a number of drivers behind the changes in our portfolio emissions, including changes in our financing across both our lending and capital markets financing activity, our clients' emissions, client data and metrics such as company valuation, and other data inputs and methodology updates as defined in our Blue Track\u2122 Financed Emissions Methodology document. We expect to continue to see these impact our metrics in the future as data availability and quality, methodologies, guidance, and best practices for calculating our financed emissions metrics -all of which include differing levels of estimation- will continue to evolve and be refined."
"a) When we first developed Blue Track\u2122, the best available scenario to develop Paris-aligned benchmarks for our financing portfolios was the International Energy Agency's Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) which was aligned to a 1.7\u2103 world. The 2025 targets set for the Energy and Power sectors were informed by the SDS scenario."

"As trusted advisers we continue to proactively engage with our clients on the risks and opportunities for their businesses arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy. This includes working with climate technology companies across their stages of development, and with larger, established and/or higher-intensity clients on their transition journeys."
"We support clients executing their climate strategies, including supporting the facilitation of initial public offerings for climate-focused growth companies, acquisitions of emerging climate technology start-ups to diversify incumbent clients' business models, and financing to mobilise the decarbonisation of operational activities."

"Sustainable Impact Capital Portfolio: Investing \u00a3500m into global climate tech start-ups"
"We firmly believe that innovation is key to tackling climate change and we are committed to supporting transformative change by investing our own capital in entrepreneurial companies. In 2020 Barclays announced that it would invest up to \u00a3175m equity capital into environmentally-focused climate technology companies by 2025 - helping support our clients to transition towards a low-carbon economy, scale solutions to environmental challenges, and fill their growth-stage funding gaps."
"In evidence of the success of the investments, in December 2022 we announced an increase of the investment mandate to invest up to E500m by the end of 2027."
"To date we have invested \u00a3138m into 21 innovative companies. These investments have supported many aspects of climate-tech innovation, from property retrofit solutions to long-duration energy storage and hydrogen technologies."
"We continue to focus on decarbonisation technologies supporting transition within carbon-intensive sectors, particularly where Barclays has meaningful client exposure - such as Power, Industry, Transport, Agriculture and Real Estate - including solutions delivering carbon capture, carbon dioxide removal and green hydrogen."
"How our sustainable financing supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"
"Since 2018, we have tracked our annual contribution to the SDGs, through our financing activities. An illustrative breakdown of our social and environmental financing is provided in the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023."
"Greener Home Propositions"
"Barclays UK is supporting retail mortgage customers' transition to a more sustainable way of living, providing products and propositions focused on retrofitting. In 2023 we rolled out training on home energy efficiency and climate risk to our mortgage advisors and hosted a webinar for mortgage brokers with retrofitting industry experts."
"We continue to support customers purchasing EPC A- and B-rated new-build homes with our Green Home Mortgage, following its expansion to include buy-to-let properties in 2022. In 2023 we lent \u00a3845m to Green Home Mortgage customers. Since inception in 2018, Barclays UK has lent over \u00a33.5bn to Green Home Mortgage customers."

"consulted, engaged, collaborated or partnered with for the purpose of implementing the Principles and improving your bank's impacts. This should include a high-level overview of how your bank has identified relevant stakeholders, what issues were addressed/results achieved"
"In our external engagement, we engaged with 10 civil society organisations (CSOs), selected by reference to their previous contact with Barclays in relation to human rights issues, and/or their recognised expertise, in particular, on the intersection between financial institutions and human rights. Engagement took place through a series of focused discussions, mostly facilitated by Shift. Our internal engagement included a series of workshops with colleagues from a range of functions including Sustainability, Risk, Compliance, Legal and the business and across the US, UK and APAC, followed by deep dive interviews with some of these colleagues."
"and how they fed into the action planning process."
"The insights gathered during this proactive engagement, complemented by insights from previous relevant engagement with CSOs, as well as desk-based research by the Barclays Social Policy team and Shift, informed the identification of a long list of human rights impacts. These impacts were then prioritised, through consideration of the relative severity of the impacts on people and their likelihood of occurrence, to produce a shortlist. This list and related analysis were presented to core stakeholders to review and test the application of the severity and likelihood criteria to finalise our five salient human rights issues, as set out on page 240 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023,"
"Engaging with industry"
"We know that leveraging the relationships we hold with stakeholders can support all of us in achieving our objectives. Continued engagement in the financial sector and other areas of the real economy and public sector will be important in delivering the actions necessary to meet our global sustainability goals. At a minimum, strategic partnerships with key stakeholders enables knowledge sharing and supports informed decision-making. Collaborating with NGOs, academia, government agencies, private sector peers, and local communities enhances our ability to understand, assess, and address the intricate issues associated with climate change. These partnerships have the potential to uncover opportunities to deploy capital into areas that suffer from existing financing gaps and scale companies to disrupt markets and innovate for impact. Information on Barclays' engagement on a range of strategic initiatives are detailed on pages 126-128 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023."

"responsibilities. This is alongside investment in our future pipeline of colleague skills through a newly created apprenticeship programme. A communications campaign informed colleagues of how Barclays is responding to climate change and sustainability more broadly, reinforcing how they can take action - including building their knowledge and skills in this area."
"During 2023 a mandatory online Climate risk training module was provided to 12,306 colleagues across Risk, Compliance, Internal Audit, Markets Post Trade and Business Banking. This training focused on the elevation of climate to a Principal Risk. In addition, a separate mandatory training module on Sustainability, ESG and Climate risk was delivered to 15,319 colleagues in 2023 across the Corporate and Investment Bank, Trade and Working Capital, Wholesale Onboarding and Group FCO, Finance, Compliance and Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility - further developing colleagues' knowledge of the core elements of ESG. This module focused on how Barclays manages Climate risk, as well as covering the Group sustainability-related statements and internal standards and how they should be applied. We also collaborated with external suppliers to deliver accredited development programmes for teams seeking to build specialist sustainability knowledge. For example, a development programme began in 2023 for 300 Corporate Bank colleagues in our Sustainability Academy pilot to develop their climate and sustainability knowledge. We intend to support more Corporate Banking colleagues through the programme during 2024. In addition, we delivered training to colleagues in Business Banking on strategies for supporting SME customers on their transition to net zero. In Q3 2023 Sustainability September, a communications campaign across the organisation helped engage colleagues on key sustainability-related topics. This included short videos, a series of live recorded conversations with senior leaders, and associated reading materials."
"To ensure our workforce of the future is well positioned to understand Climate risk, in November 2023 we introduced a new Sustainability Apprenticeship - targeting internal colleagues and working in partnership with an external provider. The apprenticeship is one of six selected by industry experts to mark His Majesty The King's Coronation, gaining recognition for educating people to understand and develop ways to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. This will encourage the building of a long-term pipeline of knowledge throughout Barclays. Incentives"
"For the Executive Directors of Barclays PLC, an element of each of their annual bonus awards and Long Term Incentive Plan awards is driven by non-financial performance measures - including measures relating to climate and sustainability."
"Barclays' performance against non-financial measures, including ESG metrics, is also explicitly considered in the determination of the incentive pool - directly impacting pay levels of the wider workforce."
"Non-financial performance for the Executive Directors' 2023 annual bonus and the 2023 incentives pool was assessed against three categories: Customers and Clients; Colleagues; and Climate and Sustainability. The latter included climate-related measures such as performance against our Sustainable and Transition Financing target, financed emissions reduction targets, carbon footprint reduction, and increase in renewable energy usage - as well as measures relating to our investment in communities."

In 2024 we have updated the Climate Change Statement to include new requirements for upstream oil and gas and restrictions on the type of exposures and risk we will finance going forward, as well as additional restrictions on financing in relation to the Amazon Biome, ultra-deep water and extra heavy oil."
"Statements and policy positions"
"any existing grievance mechanism, as\nas\nthe governance structures you have in place to oversee these risks."
"Barclays will continue to support an energy sector in transition, focusing on the diversified energy companies investing in low carbon and with greater scrutiny on those engaged in developing new upstream oil and gas projects."
"The experience of the last few years leads us to recognise that client transition pathways will vary and the ability of our clients to meet our requirements may be affected (positively or negatively) by external factors, including, for example, the public policy and regulatory environment, technological advancement, geopolitical or regional developments, energy security, cost of living and just transition factors. We intend to continue to work with and support our clients as they transition their businesses and will monitor and engage with them on their progress and the impact of external factors over time, through our Enhanced Due Diligence and Client Transition Framework."
"Further restrictions are set out in our Position Statements in relation to World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands and Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, as well as our statements on the Defence and Security sector, Human Rights and Modern Slavery. Enhanced Due Diligence Our standards currently include an enhanced due diligence approach for certain clients operating in the following energy sub-sectors covered by our Climate Change Statement: thermal coal mining, coal-fired power generation, mountain-top coal removal, oil sands, Arctic oil & gas and hydraulic fracturing ('fracking') and clients in-scope of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands and Defence and Security standards where a similar approach is taken. This approach will be extended to cover the additional sectors brought into scope of the updated Climate Change Statement. All clients in-scope of the above mentioned standards must be assessed annually via a detailed Sustainability enhanced due diligence questionnaire, which is used to evaluate their performance on a range of environmental and social issues and may be supplemented by a review of client policies / procedures, further client engagement and adverse media checks as appropriate. This annual review either generates an Environmental and Social Impact (ESI) risk rating (low, medium, high), or in the case of Defence and Security an assessment against risk appetite, which in turn determines whether further review and client engagement may be required throughout the year. High and certain medium ESI-rated clients would require further risk assessment prior to execution of transactions with those clients.

This limited our analysis to certain geographies and sectors, as NACE code mapping is currently only available for balance sheet elements where there was a regulatory need. Given the data challenges we have encountered while using the UNEP Fl's impact analysis tool we will, in future years, use the outputs of the 'impact materiality' part of a double materiality assessment to meet principle 2.1 of the PRB requirements. This will enable us to assess impact across all material parts of the business and product sets, while also enabling us to meet upcoming regulatory requirements."

"Disclaimer"
"Information provided in climate and sustainability disclosures"
"What is important to our investors and stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to anticipate and respond to these changes. Disclosure expectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving, and differ from more traditional areas of reporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts on the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and sustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the development of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and nature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and sustainability disclosures are subject to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects, given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and timeliness - the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions which are likely to change over time, the application and development of data, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards."
"These factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability develops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate and sustainability disclosures. We give no assurance as to the likelihood of the achievement or reasonableness of any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns contained in our climate and sustainability disclosures and make no commitment to revise or update any such disclosures to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of such statements."
"Disclaimers"
"In preparing the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure wherever it appears, we have:"
"a. Made certain key judgements, estimations and assumptions. This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and sustainability metrics, measurement of climate risk and scenario analysis"
"b. Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies we consider to be appropriate and suitable for these purposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and methodologies made available by third parties (over which we have no control) and which may have been prepared using a range of different methodologies, or where the basis of preparation may not be known to us. Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being independently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies are subject to future risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Climate and sustainability disclosures in this document, including climate and sustainability-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information and use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate and sustainability disclosures are also not subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data cannot be relied on as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis"
"c. Continued (and will continue) to review and develop our approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with market principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and methodologies used (including those made available by third parties) and the judgements, estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and sustainability content within this disclosure. Further, changes in external factors which are outside of our control such as accounting and/or reporting standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/or updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact - potentially materially - the performance metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in this disclosure. In future disclosures we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties) using updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies, market practices or standards. Equally, we may need to re-baseline, restate, revise, recalculate or recalibrate performance against targets, convergence points or milestones on the basis of such updated data. Such updated information may result in different outcomes than those included in this disclosure. It is important for readers and users of this disclosure to be aware that direct, like-for-like comparisons of each piece of information disclosed may not always be possible from one reporting period to another. The \"Implementing our climate strategy\" section of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023 highlights where information in respect of a previous reporting period has been updated. Our principles-based approach to reporting financed emissions data (see page 84 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023) sets out when financed emissions information in respect of a prior year will be identified and explained."
"KPMG LLP has performed limited independent assurance over selected climate and sustainability content, which has been marked with the symbol 4. The assurance engagement was planned and performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance of Greenhouse Gas Statements. A limited assurance opinion was issued and is available at the website link below. This includes details of the scope, reporting criteria, respective responsibilities, work performed, limitations and conclusion. No other information in this disclosure, other than our responses to criteria 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 5.1 which have been marked with the symbol A has been subject to this external limited assurance. There are a variety of internal and external factors which may impact our reported metrics and progress against our targets, convergence points and milestones."

"Forward-looking statements"
"This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance, and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but may also be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group, including during management presentations, in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, business strategy, income levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions - including policy on dividends and share buybacks - return on tangible equity, projected levels of growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, any commitments and targets - including ESG commitments and targets - plans and objectives for future operations, and other statements that are not historical or current facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation; regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices, and the interpretation thereof; changes in International Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting standards, including practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and similar events beyond the Group's control; the impact of competition in the banking and financial services industry; capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital markets; market-related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on European and global macroeconomic conditions, political stability and financial markets; political elections; developments in the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security breaches, technology failures or other operational disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group's reputation, business or operations; the Group's ability to access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these factors are beyond the Group's control."
"As a result, the Group's actual financial position, results, financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. Without limitation, in setting its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain assumptions about the macroeconomic environment, including inflation, interest and unemployment rates, the different markets and competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors that may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in the description of material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2023."
"Subject to Barclays PLC's obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction - including, without limitation, the UK and the US - in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."
